            ">if you were born rich, so what?\n\nA lot of rich people are capable of intuiting how gross it is to have been born rich, so weaving a false narrative of humble beginnings or hard work is a way to try to convince others that you're one of the rich people who \"deserve\" to be rich.",

            "Its an ego problem. Being rich, in their mind, often gives them the right to feel ‚Äòabove‚Äô others. If they somehow ‚Äòlegitimately‚Äô found a way to be wealthy when they were at the bottom while hundreds of other people didn‚Äôt that, to them, is all they need to start being self congratulatory elitists. \n\nAnother way to look at it- they purposefully forgot life starts with the cards you‚Äôre dealt and sometimes you get a bad hand and play it well with the luck and wit you‚Äôve found and sometimes you‚Äôre dealt a hand so good no matter what you do you‚Äôll win (rich kids) on paper. They‚Äôd like you to think they started with a similar hand to you. Rich kids/people that were given their wealth hate this reality because it totally fucks up the idea that they are deserving of their status.",

I was like, good for you. Then I found out her family sent her to a glitzy private school in Switzerland for many years.",
            "Perhaps unpopular opinion, but there is a a lot of hate towards rich people. Ex: when the sub imploded near titanic people where making fun of it online even when their deaths were not even confirmed. It was jokes about how they deserved it etc and it was being upvoted a lot as well. I think some rich people are ashamed that they are rich. I think they are because they know how many people feel about rich people.   Personally, I think that rich people hate is kind of sad because it comes from jealousy and the sense that all rich people somehow got that money in an unfair way. \n\nEven if you were born super rich, you should not have to be ashamed of that. Being rich and an asshole, however, should be shameful however. Being poor and an asshole should also be shameful.",

Her dad was an electrician and her mum was a hairdresser, so it's fully possible that they considered themselves and their family to be working class. The fact that a working class person hits it big and builds a business doesn't, in most cases, change their class identity. The degree to which that's then passed down to the kids is debatable, but if the wealth wasn't always there, and only came into the family at some point during childhood, many kids would still maintain a stable view of the class they are from. So there are a lot of potential layers here. It could be perfectly reasonable to say 'Dad was working class' even if he drove a roller at one point, or that the family was working class if that's how both parents identified. It's much harder for her to claim 'I am working class' if she grew up with wealth and a private school education, but she seems to be talking here about her family background more generally.",

You can describe them as being from a working class background and self-made, but you cannot say they are working class, as their lifestyle will not be comparable to that of truly working class people.

            "Watched this last night and thought it was good. The affair stuff was odd...they didn't really say anything that either confirmed or denied it, which in my eyes was kind of an admission that there was in fact an affair/affairs. I'm glad and impressed they didn't skip over the whole fiasco because I genuinely thought they would.",
            "I remember at the time not understanding why Victoria stayed with him. There was an interview with his mistress Rebecca Loos (who was their assistant) in which she said that Victoria once cried and told her she felt like she wasn‚Äôt pretty enough for David and was scared that he wasn‚Äôt attracted to her anymore. It broke my heart that the woman she opened up to would then go on to start an affair with him.\n\nIt always gave me the impression of Victoria utterly adoring David and him lapping it up. Especially as their relationship progressed and she wasn‚Äôt the most famous one anymore. \n\nBut now that they‚Äôve been together for so long, it does seem like the love is definitely mutual and they are truly happy together. Watching the documentary, he definitely seems crazy about her as well.",

It's interesting they both frame it like it was something other people did to them and not something David had to address himself.",
            "honestly, i feel like they‚Äôve had an open or fluid relationship from the jump. i think the reason that this instance was more painful/specific was because of how sloppy david was about it. it ruined their image/brand and embarrassed victoria. i think THAT was the issue, and that‚Äôs why they keep projecting this as if the media is the problem vs the fact that david stepped out on her.",

He could have said they tried therapy, or had long talks, or decided to put the children first. I realise he's skirting around the issue and trying not to admit to anything, but did he really just wait for Victoria to forgive him?

            "It‚Äôs a weird way of dancing around saying he had an affair. Shit and get off the pot, why talk about it if they aren‚Äôt going to say he was fucking about?",
            "I can't help but wonder...why even bring it up if there was no truth to it?  And why be so \"hurt\" if there is no truth to it.  I've heard crazy rumours about myself (and I am definitely no one famous) and they are hilarious.  If it weren't true, my husband and I would have laughed our asses off and said nope not true.  Maybe it isn't true and they are just trying to fuel interest in Season 2 by dancing around it.  They are business people above all.  I also wonder why this rumour was never ever discussed in a \"me too\" setting. She was their employee, a personal assistant.  Why is it that with David Beckham we talk about it as an \"affair\", like she was their next door neighbour or fitness trainer, which is so different from how we talk about these situations now - I guess it was a different time. The whole employer/employee things puts a creepy spin on it.\n\nI don't doubt that there was some genuine attraction between them, but I did get a weird feeling when he said he was going to marry her after seeing her on TV.  Do men even talk about women that way? It reminds me of women in the 50s saying \"He's a dreamboat, I am going to marry him\".  Maybe UK men are different, but I can't imagine many of the men I know speaking that way. And the way he talked about her when he was told she was one of the SGs at the game.  Very creepily strategic.\n\nAnd no doubt he is a man with a big appetite for everything - food, cars, clothes, houses, women...men with appetites like this want to consume it all.",
            "I'm surprised they even alluded to this time in their marriage because most people forgot about this scandal by now. Why do I feel like it's preemptive damage control? Is more gonna come out about David? and they are trying to get ahead of it",
            "Can't believe people think he cheated this one time. He STILL cheats. They are a BRAND. Their lives depend on it.",
            "I don't think he cheated.  But I also don't care.  If she doesn't, why should I?  Always wondered why the public gets so caught up in this.  She stayed with him, it's not for me to judge it.  I know nothing about their private life.  Y'all getting all psychological on her...really?",
            "I hope they've been to therapy, but I doubt it.",

            "It felt like it was mentioned because to completely ignore it would seem strange, since it was a big deal at the time. But, they are entitled to privacy in their marriage. I'm sure it was a terrible time (especially for Victoria, whom I love) but if they managed to get through it and are happy now, that's all that matters. Besides, this documentary was more about David's career, not to drudge up the drama.",

And then you get to that country and you find out he's been having an affair. That is emotional turmoil, and I feel so bad for Victoria Beckham she looked like she was still ready to break down when she was talking about it. I had severe PPD after my pregnancy and if I had been dealing with all those circumstances, I don't think I would've made it through to the end honestly.",

            "I haven't seen the whole thing but I do get the impression from these clips that there were multiple affairs and they have only decided to name one.

The man cheated coz he was lonely or he's a powerful man, a desirable man and they cheat but when a woman cheats, she's a whore, she's a train wreck, she broke the family. Like the man's cheating is marked as a tough time while the woman's cheating is marked as a disgusting event that only brings up contempt in those around her and in the world.",
            "I think that's a thing they're taught in PR training.\n\nI took a linguistic anthropology class, and one of the sections we dissected an interview with Lance Armstrong talking about blood doping. In his PR trained responses, it was always either external (something that was done to him) or so far in the past that it was like a different person (he often talked about *that* Lance). It was only when he was pressed or got flustered that he'd make \"I\" statements related to what he'd done. \n\nAnyway, they're responses here feel (to me) a lot like that kind of externalizing.\n\nThe other option, of course, is that it could be that that's how they cope. That that kind of externalization was what made it possible for them to move past it.\n\nI just assumed that, because they can afford it, they probably got training on how to frame it.",

            "At the time, it felt like most of the judgement went to Victoria,  cos she didn't move to Spain with him.",
            "I think it would have gone down better if David had held himself accountable, like \"I was sold from the club that I was with since I was a child, was in a foreign country where I didn't know the language and didn't have my family- and I made the biggest mistake of my life.\" Just at least an acknowledgment that he fucked up.\n\nMy impression is that they just agreed to stay together and never talk about it again and/or David will make sure to be more discreet in any future affairs. That being said, it's been so long since that whole brouhaha so I can see why Victoria seems so detached when talking about it.",
            "I disagree actually. Her experience of the affair is her own, and I understand why the judgment could be by far the hardest part.. Fidelity matters to differing degrees for everyone; for that matter, so does societal support. Maybe the infidelity wasn‚Äôt the worst part, but rather she thinks the most painful part was how they navigated it, and that the pressure on them to separate was the opposite of what she needed, and she just felt fucking lonely, and she is happy she and David are close again. I can kinda understand that.",
            "I get what you‚Äôre saying but this isn‚Äôt couples counseling, it‚Äôs a documentary they‚Äôre sharing with the word. The only person he owes an apology to is her and his kids and I don‚Äôt think we have to be part of that. We are part of the public response that made it probably 1000x harder for her to deal with it. I can see why she‚Äôd forgive her husband who she loves, but not the public who doesn‚Äôt know her.",
            "Someones feeling about an event is really the part the matters in the end. That is how we all process and understand our lives.",

The mistress outed him.\n\nHe and his wife both know it happened, and collectively decided not to acknowledge it.  He's obviously gross for having an affair.\n\nBut as soon as Victoria decided to forgive him and to refuse to acknowledge it, the mistress had already lost.  It's not clear why she wants the public to acknowledge the affair.  Why did she want anyone to know in the first place, 20 years ago?   In a weird way, it's not her business, now that Victoria has clearly let it go.",
            "Right? Like I need her to pop through a door and be like, ‚ÄúBe honest. What‚Äôs it you did, David? What‚Äôs it you did?‚Äù And then when he says ‚ÄúI had an affair‚Äù she just closes the door.",
            "Why should she though?

            "Ugh shes one of those women with no backbone",
            "Yeah, I remember feeling like the tension in their marriage at that time was about the fact he‚Äôd slept with someone so indiscreet and so good at the media game, not that he‚Äôd slept with someone. \n\nWhen Loos first sold her story they just kind of batted it away like it was nothing and still seemed perfectly happy. The cracks started to show a couple of months later when the story was still everywhere and Loos was successfully parlaying it into minor celebrity status.",
            "There were serious rumors that she had an affair with Damon Dash. I remember reading about it at the time. FWIW, I‚Äôve always thought they had an open relationship, mostly bc they‚Äôre ultra-wealthy.",
            "That's not how I took it - him saying 'I don't know' was like him admitting it was a miracle they made it, alluding to how bad they were. Not that he actually does not know how/why things improved.",
            "I interpreted his reaction here and him saying he didn't know as humility. I felt like his face said that he didn't think he deserved her forgiveness; like, \"I have no idea how she was able to stay with me\".",
            "What people think she doesn't have feelings? Those are horrible people. Just because someone is not outwardly emotionally expressive doesn't mean they don't have feelings, much less deep and painful ones. I bet one of the big reasons people feel free to be shitty to some women is this expectation to see emotional expression on women. And then of course if she were to ever break down, they'd declare the emotional reaction to be fake.",
            "I can‚Äôt blame her for being aloof. Showing hurt takes vulnerability and I can understand why she wouldn‚Äôt feel comfortable being vulnerable given the way she has been treated by the media at times.",

            "There‚Äôs an old video of them, probably 15, 20 years old, in some interview or maybe it was a talk show. Victoria is incredibly humorous, and laughing all the time. Completely different to what she usually shows to the public.",
            "I always think she is very aloof in public but more honest in her private life.",
            "I think it's more of a conscious choice rather than aloofness. Victoria knows their brand is stronger as a couple. Also, his fortune ensures a great life for her and their children. Victoria was always the manager of their wealth (it is mentioned that before Victoria David spent all his money). Lastly, I read that VB's company is loss-making and David's company has put money in it to help. \n\nI think they love each other but as a couple they are rather superficial, they don't look into themselves that much (the director confirms this for David in an interview).",
            "I still think that‚Äôs why she doesn‚Äôt smile much. She‚Äôs possibly hurting on the inside and people instead judge her.",

            "Ugh. \"The Crown\" kind of touched on Phillip maybe having affairs. I was hoping it wasn't true. I hope she had some as well, otherwise that's so shitty and one sided.",
            "Yeah I'm curious about how people can learn about the cheating and then claim that he's still clearly in love with Victoria. Why do people give David a pass like this? If it was any other male celebrity we'd be calling him out on his BS. How can you love someone but then cheat on them? These two things are entirely contradictory to me.",
            "No but that's actually why I find this clip juicy. At the time David insisted it was a lie, and Victoria publicly said she believed him. This clip makes it *so* obvious that he cheated, even if they didn't say it in absolute terms. He looks guilty af. Personally I take this as their first time admitting to everything.",
            "These people pay companies to scrub the internet of the things they don't want out there.  Ever wonder why we never see photos of  famous or wealthy people's children when they are in university/college?  In today's world where everyone has a camera on a phone?  I wouldn't be surprised if they have people working at promoting the funny working class commentary and squashing the affair commentary.",
            "I think these two legit love each other. Whether or not he cheats or has a pass, idk. Sometimes rumors are unsubstantiated but take hold because they fit our preconceived ideas. And sometimes a couple agrees that monogamy isn't a priority but public humiliation is. Thats their prerogative. Either way, you just have to see how they interact when they don't realize cameras are on them to know this is a real relationship.",
            "Imo - I hope that  Victoria enjoys seeing other men if  the allegations are true.",

            "This documentary has many people thinking this is an epic lovely marriage. And yes good for them for making it work through cheating, but it‚Äôs ironic how David gets a pass meanwhile other celebrity men who have cheated still get shitted on (and rightfully so ofc).",

            "How do you do a documentary with David Beckham without touching on his time in Madrid? You think the Taylor Swift effect is consuming oxygen at Chiefs games? You have no idea, lol. This was massive and the coverage didn't just sit in tabloid media. The fallout followed him to work.",
            "I felt the same, I had no idea about the affair. I think they mentioned it preemptively as to not lack authenticity. If they released the documentary without mentioning it we would find out anyway and would be talking about how the affair wasn't mentioned ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|shrug).",
            "I‚Äôm all over the place üò≠. But thank you lol. It‚Äôs fascinating watching people say their relationship is  ‚Äúreal genuine love‚Äù. Although in the beginning I agree it was. But now‚Ä¶",
            "I mean, she's clearly saying that he hurt her with his actions and it was a bad time for her... that doesn't sound like she was thrilled or fine with what he did.\n\nThey clearly had different expectations in their relationship, and he violated her trust. No one is being pearl clutchy, they're just reacting to what she states.",
            ">This idea that there needs to be one person to meet our sexual and emotional needs for life is very new\n\nReally? I see it as the opposite. Historically people have absolutely been expected to have one life partner; 50 years ago it was difficult, if not illegal, to get a divorce. Some countries have only allowed it in the last 30 years. I think there's much more understanding now that \"lifelong\" or even long-term relationships are difficult. And there's definitely more understanding of polygamy than ever before, even if it's still seen as unsavory by a lot of people.",
            "No one is talking about non monogamy or saying anything is wrong with it.  \n\nI if they are in one then okay, good for them but they publicly appear to be very monogamous and we feel bad for her.   You ENM people really need to relax. No one is prosecuting you. You are not a marginalised group",
            "tbf i saw people talking about this stuff first.  not defending her but i think people have just been waiting for them to address the situation for a while now",
            "I feel like if he were to cheat it wouldnt be out of maliciousness and playboyness. I think it was due to sheer loneliness and reaction to the struggle in Manchester and Madrid. What was done to David in England is truly traumatic, and he probably did really need the support from Victoria, but it also isn't fair to expect her to drop everything. Being in that world is far more emotionally complicated than people let on. And it didn't seem like he was cheating with club rats... He was alleged with women who were close to him in his everyday life, like his PA... though she seems like a clout-seeking attention seeker. \n\nOverall, it's extremely complicated, but not an excuse to cheat on your wife. He should have been forthright about his struggles in Madrid with Posh :/ I still stan them though.",

            "What a slap in the face to her when he says he has noidea how they got through it.",
            "Exactly what made my blood boil. And from what I recall Rebecca Loos wasn‚Äôt the only woman he cheated on her with.",

            "This makes me sad, I always remember in the spice girls book I had growing up she was particularly open about struggling with depression. It seems like being expected to ‚Äòdeal‚Äô Is something she‚Äôs experienced a lot in life.",
            "So much this. When he lost the world cup the first time he flies to New York with her and the Spice Girls and Victoria was talking about how they protected him while he was there and made sure he was ok etc. But then you see all of the mental warfare using her as the collateral damage that the fans would put her through and the media would put her through to get at David and you don't see him at all trying to protect her. Only for him to cheat on her and think of himself and his childish wants over his families needs.  What I took away from the documentary is not how great he is but rather Victoria is stronger than I would have been to deal with all of the things he put her through.",
            "I interpreted that as \"I **really** know how we got through it\" and David will surely agree from now on with what Victoria says - there you see the example of how they didn‚Äôt stay in Spain.",
            "I always think this. I wonder how many celebrities have open relationships, and don't want to let the public into that knowledge for obvious reasons",
            "I think the embarrassment of how public it was, was the thing that annoyed her most. I do think they had a \"what happens on the road, stays on the road\" type understanding. Once that understanding was challenged publicly though, I'm sure it was rough for them. And I say them, because if it was an arrangement they both were okay with, then it's an issue they both had to deal with. \n\nAlso, I think it's easy when things are out of sight, out of mind. But when shit is staring you in the face, you realize that maybe that's not the life you want. I think that happened for them as well. I think he was incredibly embarrassed and remorseful over his actions. And I think Victoria probably realized whatever agreement they had wasn't gonna fly now that they were parents with a family to lose.",

It's more than 20 years ago and it's about a Spice Girl! Crikey!",
            "In watching the doc, you definitely see her going from being so silly on camera during the Spice Girls days, to being very stoic now.  Hearing her discuss the amount of turmoil they went through with the press and the paparazzi and the threats to their baby once he was born may play a factor in the change in her outward appearance.  I don't know one way or another, but this is me guessing just based on what I'm seeing.  She certainly seems to have very strong feelings, but I think perhaps she just stopped giving the public anything when she started to feel fearful and attacked by the public.  I certainly can understand that, and would probably take on that same form of armor if I were in her shoes.",

To him, his wife and kids are just something to fall back on, support him emotionally and make him look good. He never would have had this career if it wasn't for Victoria carying all the mental load. And even after all of that, he still seems bitter towards her in every single exchange they have in the documentary. \n\nI can't believe people online are praising him, becauseI have a totally different takeaway from this documentary. I watched it thinking of all the women that were working overtime free labor, just to allow these sports events to happen. Victoria is just one of them. And then we're in 2023 and they complain about the lonely men epidemic?! This documentary is a good exemple of why woman chose to be single over caring for a man as the more difficult child of the family.",
            "I think Spain was too much for Victoria from the get go as she stated her dislike of being there (she denies it but I thought it was odd when the tabloids in Spain published that Victoria said it smells of garlic there as an insult, heh). David seemed to be uncomfortable there as he didn't have his family in the way he had prior, didn't speak the language and so on. He also said that his manager told him he will never play for Spain again when he thought David was speaking to other scouts or whatever he called them, and then went to the US.",

Or that I don't need help in situations where anyone would need help - just because I don't look \"needy\" I guess? \n\nIt can be downright dangerous in medical contexts when people, even professionals, disregard your pain/distress like that.

All the naughty extra-marital stuff was incredibly hush hush. Your examples support what I'm saying and it still happened just 60 or 70 years ago (or less in the most traditional countries). I'm not surprised society hasn't quite moved past that mindset, even though it's improving. \n\nIf we look at the entirely of human history then okay, lifelong monogamy wasn't an expectation until far down the line. But we know for sure it goes as far back as the Bible, since it describes marriage as sacred and extra-marital sex as sinful.",

I have a big soft spot for Victoria and think she gets a lot of unfair criticism. When you see her interviewed etc she always come across as a warm person with a good sense of humour.

She even says she internalized a lot of frustrations because she didn‚Äôt want to affect his playing (RE him messing up the game she was pregnant). He also came off as someone who was very needy/codependent. Heck even Gary said how becks could not function if posh wasn‚Äôt around.

            "There are many athletes who are on the spectrum and go undiagnosed through out their lives. They have rigid system in place that supports their special needs. And since they are gifted in popular thing they are given much more leeway in everyday interactions than their non-gifted peers might be.\n\nSo your vision is totally within reason.",
            "My favourite narrative is that Dennis Rodman was ND. I mean I don't think this is that controversial of a take, but I shall give my two favourite examples:\n\n1. In basketball whenever someone gets fouled the game gets paused and a player shoots two free throws, meaning no defense. Dennis Rodman was notoriously bad at shooting free throws, but miraculously whenever he needed to hit them, he usually did. His explanation was that free throws were boring and he wanted the game to continue.\n\n2. Before games Dennis Rodman would count the amount of times his teammates ball spun in the air during a shot instead of warming up himself. If a ball spins more it has more backspin and will therefore bounce more \"straight\".\n\nProbably way more examples and reasons, but those are my favourites.",
            "I recognized right away. OCD is under the neurodiverent umbrella. I am a swim coach and believe this- a lot of my athletes are neurodiverent. A special interest plus hyperactivity with a strong consistent routine equals mental clarity. It can be lifesaving for some kids.",

            "You were the first search when I googled \"is David beckham autistic\"\n\nThe fixation on football, struggling in mainstream school, issues understanding other people's emotions, just many moments have me wondering if he's on the spectrum. \n\nI'm only on the second episode and it's so sad that his mistake brought on so much anger and he dealt with death threats and people hating him and he almost when dissociative to manage.\n\nWhether he is or isn't- shows his character he went through all that and is still one of the most influential footballers of our time x",

It got him a D1 football scholarship but like no neurotypical person has every variation of multiple teams uniforms over the years memorized.",
            "Yeah, like I was watching some of the England football women‚Äôs team do interviews about their life and many of their answers about themselves and their childhoods scream ND.\n\nMary Earps the goalkeeper for instance was bullied constantly at school and felt like she never fit in and frequently ‚Äústruggled to understand what was going on‚Äù. She felt like sports was an escape for her.\n\nThis is a story I hear over and over again in many highly successful athletes and musicians.\n\nHypermobility which is common in ND‚Äôs can also be very beneficial for sports and instrument playing.\n\nNikki Lauda is a bit different (racing driver) but I‚Äôm almost certain he was on the spectrum. \n\nHe was extremely stubborn and essentially cut ties with his family to pursue F1 racing. He would push himself and his car mechanics to the limits to always do better. His ex wife described him as an ‚Äúasshole‚Äù who was very logical, perfectionist, analytical but emotionally unavailable and cold. He admits that he doesn‚Äôt have many friends. He said ‚ÄúI hate gray areas, I only think in black and white‚Äù. \n\nAlex Honnold is almost certainly on the spectrum too.\n\nIf channeled correctly and with the right circumstances, the black and white/all or nothing thinking, perfectionism, stubbornness and obsessiveness/hyperfixating tendencies of ND‚Äôs can help in achieving huge success in fields like sport.",

One example: England's \"Act of Apparel\" in January 1483 meant that only knights and lords could wear materials like cloth-of-gold, sable, ermine, velvet on velvet and satin brocade...they didn't want any of those filthy new money merchants looking like them.\n\nSorry, ramble over!",

Another example is Fermin who finished secondary school and also  persuaded and study a program while he was playing on 3rd division , not only that but Ferming was thinking on not persuading football anymore if he could not break into a first division team at his age , and then Xavi recognize how much talent and potential he got and the rest is history. \n\n- Manchester City youth academy have to prioritize studies over football first. Even legends of United like Rooney put his son on City academy because other than having a better structure , it puts education before football. \n\n- Other incredible players have study university before playing full time , study after they finished playing profesionally or have being juggling between the two of them. Robin Van Persie actually study at a university when he was playing in the Netherlands before he move to Arsenal iirc , Juan Mata study university while he was playing in Valencia and finished them when he was at Chelsea if i am not wrong , Van Der Saar study accounting after he retired from United and work for his first club , Iniesta study on the INEF while he was playing at Barcelona , this was meme a lot but Robert Lewandowski have a degree on physical education but \"rumors\" mentioned that he paid for it  (this was around 2017) , Fabregas was studying business management during his academy years in Barca and first years in Arsenal , Azpilicueta studied \"sport media and entretaintment\" from Harvard university lol.

Huge trophy cabinet. Elite crossing, passing, and especially work rate. A dead ball specialist (still has the EPL goal record). Could turn and progress the ball at a VERY high level. If anything, Beckham was ahead of his time as a press-resistant winger who could step inside and help progress the ball and outwork everyone else on the pitch.",
            "I get what you're saying, although I wouldn't go as far as to say he was merely above average as an overall player.

Being exceptional at only set pieces and crossing isn't going to achieve all of that. Otherwise, guys like Juninho would've been right up there with him with the accolades.\n\nYes, it's true he wasn't the most physically gifted or dynamic player you'll ever see, but even aside from his notable dead ball and passing skills, his football IQ, positioning, vision, and resilience were simply on another level from the vast majority of footballers I've ever seen.

Most of these people have a vocation they pursue for their own reasons. It doesnt need to be profitable, they work their own hours, take months or years off, etc. Its not work how anyone would define actual work like the working class does.\n\nAs far as comments like a \"second hand Rolls Royce.\" Note a Rolls Royce is a $300k car. So even a used one is like a mortgage on a home. Even a doctor isn't going to be able to float a $250k car loan on top of home, student loans, and other bills.\n\nIts also worth mentioning that landed gentry isn't really a thing under capitalism. The lands back then were for farming where a lot of the money came from. Nowadays, farming isn't a big money maker. Investing, tech, finance, etc are. So if she's saying \"We didnt grow up on an old estate like the super rich,\" but instead in a beautiful London home, with clearly multi-millionaire parents, etc and its not really saying anything. Its not like its 1860 anymore and you need to be a Downton Abbey-like titled woman to be rich.",

            "Class isn't just about money, e.g. \"you can't buy class\". Historic family assets and education level is a better proxy than just ¬£.\n\nFor example, Rupert the addict may be in and out of rehab with his drug problem but his family own 5% of the land in the UK and he went to Winchester - can't really be more upper class. Sophie is a teacher on an average wage, went to university like most of her family,  she's struggling to make ends meet, but her parents are accountants/lawyers with a pleasant detached house in a conservation area - solidly middle class. Darren the builder left school at 16, went into construction ended up with a successful construction business, now he's got a multi-million pound house and a McLaren in the driveway - still working class.\n\nIf there was an upper class social event, Darren might not be welcome were Rupert would be, because Darren isn't \"people like us\".\n\nThe other weird thing in the UK is you'll be able to tell most of this about someone in the UK within 30 seconds of speaking to them, just from the style of speech. It leads to strange scenarios were experts in a field may not be given due respect just because they speak like a pauper with a regional accent.",

            "They do it for class warfare reasons.

These people dont want you to know the joys of having independence wealth because those joys are a burden on the working class. We're the ones cleaning her toilet, driving her car, serving her food, etc. Pretending class doesn't exist in capitalism is one of its greatest dishonesties.\n\nSo its a concentrated effort by a lot of people to hide how good they have it.

Marx made a bit of a distinction between the \"haute bourgeoisie\", or upper middle class, and the petit bourgeoisie, or lower middle class. The difference being, the haute b. are those who are sufficiently established into ownership of things that they don't *have* to work. Though many might do so, the value of that work can be controversial: truly beneficial with utility for others, or it could be busywork akin to feuding warlords who while they might have kept busy, their 'work' was not useful to anyone but them and was not missed when they were gone. In contrast the petit bourgeoisie are those who might have some small ownership stake but nonetheless have to work to live.\n\n\"The definition of the thing\", mate, definitions do matter, but they are *descriptive* not prescriptive, folks have used the concept of class in many different ways over the years. In the modern era, yes, many folks would consider a successful business man or lawyer or whatever, to be upper class, especially if the have such a sum as to effectively establish multigenerational wealth going forward, trust fund babies, etc, who don't have to work if they don't want to (haute bourgeoisie).",

A caste system would be a descendance only based system.\n\nMost aristocrats have some point in their family tree where someone made money in business or had good fortune and was made influential somehow, allowing them to make money and connections. While lineage is a strong currency in that part of society, that doesn't make it absolute.\n\nThe real issue that people have with it is that class is deeply cultural in countries like the UK. While you might not become a titled aristocrat in the UK without familial ties, that really only applies to a tiny percentage of members of the more influential, monied and powerful cultural cliques in UK society. You don't need a title to be upper class even if titles help.\n\nWhat class really consists in is a system of cultural exclusiveness that tries to vet the character of its members through a very opaque system of judgement. It is not grounded in the universalism of a \"we're all the same and of equal social worth and money is the determiner of our success and utility\" like \"new world\" capitalism. It's very much grounded in the idea that high class, \"high value\" people are of a certain cultural persuasion, most markedly in their accomplishment of remarkable things.\n\nPeople born into \"high class\" families have a unwarranted advantage in this cultural sphere since they are raised with different expectations of what matters if you are to succeed in this class-based system than others who are raised blissfully unaware of it.\n\nUltimately this is what angers people, since people are openly being judged on their characters by strangers according to a system of values that ordinary people simply do not have the ability to know. Who wants to be subject to appraisal by a bunch of elitists in order to process in society?\n\nSo while the tabloids and critics might makes remarks about Middleton's appropriateness for a royal title based on her lineage, she's in many ways ensured that her offspring will have unquestioned admission to the highest class society on the basis of their descendance as in 3 generations nobody will remember her grandfather was a coal miner, but will remember that her descendants had a princess in their family tree, which is how aristocracy works.",

            "His father working would make him either middle class or working class.\n\nRoughly speaking:\n\nWorking class is if he worked in a factory or a mine or as a manual labourer or a bus driver or a builder or a variety of other things.\n\nMiddle class is if he sat in an office somewhere.",
            "Okay, but what are the hard numbers for your folks' income lol\n\nIdk why people keep dodging this question. I don't care how frugally they lived or whatever, that doesn't actually tell me about their economic situation",
            "Why? For stating a basic historical fact? While the media might not celebrate that part of US history and like to pretend that it has been a \"melting pot\" / \"don't begrudge a someone their success\" / \"meritocracy through hard work\" / \"it's not where you're from but where you're going\" type culture since its inception, pretty much all of these are inventions of the very late 19th and even more the early 20th century.   \n\nThe founding fathers were almost exclusively provincial Englishmen of a whiggish political leaning. The Whigs historically represented the deeply protestant English upper middle classes who made money in commerce and trade. I suppose that not being the true blueblood European aristocracy made them less dogmatically focused on breeding, but just because they didn't suffer from the same cultural hangover from the medieval period, didn't make them modern egalitarians in any respect.\n\nTheir extreme Protestantism made them very much look down on anyone who wasn't also a well established protestant. Much of Protestant theology was to do with the notion of divine providence and basically suggested that the rich and powerful were that way because they were righteous in the eyes of the Lord, while the poor were being punished for their moral failings. They were \"liberals\", but only in the sense of wanting to be left alone to practise their \"true\" faith and by extension being willing to leave other groups alone (who they essentially saw as heretical to greater or lesser extents, depending on their beliefs). They didn't marry or mix with people they saw as heretics. They didn't even want to owe them the kind of minimal civil duty of care that would have been expected in a European nation state.\n\nThe whole revolutionary ideology the US was founded on can be traced back to the liberty doctrines arising after the English civil war, which was won by whiggish protestant parliamentarians over the conservative royalists (who were sympathetic with Catholicism). That whole war was fought because the then monarch tried to raise taxes to fund foreign wars that were unpopular. There is a clear comparison with the American revolution and, heck, even the legal basis for \"no taxation without representation\" can be traced to that era. The core of the issue was religious pluralism and the degree to which communities within a nation state can be compelled, in the name of national collectivism, to aid other groups with whom they might not share a common religious or cultural identity.\n\nPower in the USA for the first century of its history remained almost exclusively with protestants of mostly British descent, with a few Dutch and Scandinavians thrown in since they often followed acceptably similar liberal protestant religious theologies. Even Germans weren't welcome at the table unless they were the right kind of Germans with the correct religious beliefs and backgrounds (most were Catholic while others were from more radical and impoverished strains of Protestantism e.g. Mennonites, making them unwelcome in the halls of power). \n\nIt was only when the USA came into its own as an industrial power in the late 19th century, after the ending of slavery, when suddenly a non-protestant could use his own culture's human capital to achieve commercial success, amassing fortunes that rivalled those of the land-owning agrarian pseudo-aristocracy, that anything like a \"melting pot\" situation started to arise in the USA. And while it was a melting pot of sorts, it was still deeply racist and culturally segregated along the lines of religion and heritage. The reason why most older and larger US cities have \"little Italys\" and \"Germantowns\" is because it was still effectively ghettoised. \n\nThe widespread acceptance of the melting pot ideology i.e. that anyone could make it in America regardless of culture and birth (provided they were broadly white European of course), didn't even take hold until even later, after WW1 with the romanticism of the roaring 1920s when the country became enamoured with the idea of throwing off European ways and customs and boldly asserting its own view of the world. You now had Catholics, Orthodox, and Jews making so much money that it was hard to maintain the premise that the US was nation controlled by liberal protestants. Nonetheless, even then families like the Kennedys had to fight, bribe, and marry their way into respectability among the dominant WASP class, and still look what happened to JFK as late as the 60s.\n\nUS education and Hollywood might not like to focus on this aspect of its own history and prefer to showcase the changes that happened later as a sign of its progressivism and freedom from \"old world\" nepotism, but like most national mythologies, it's exactly that... mythos, and anyone who's ever picked up a history book can tell you the same.",

            "Ya it is a documentary. The director shouldn‚Äôt have any control over the subjects. If he thought she would have responded differently alone, he could have got her in an interview by herself.",

            "In other words, he got chewed out by Posh Spice after the show aired",
            "I call bs, the ONLY sound bite anyone will ever remember from that documentary was this.  Being truthful is what makes a documentary good-no one wants to hear another rich person go on about their ‚Äòtough‚Äô upbringing especially when it‚Äôs bs.",
            "He wasn't honest about kicking the soccer balls into trash cans on the beach. He said it was real when it was fake. I'm not a fan but on the other end Steph Curry almost immediately admitted him shooting the consecutive half court shots was fake.",

            "It was a great defining moment in the documentary. Showed how down to earth, human and honest Beckham is.

The director and writers basically know what the story will be like before they ever show up on set.  This comes from research, planning, and preliminary interviews. The actual documentary part is them basically makjbg a movie retracing the steosnof their research and reasking the questions they already asked previously.",

            "They based an entire Superbowl ad around it too",
            "This reminded me of the Friends reunion a few years back, throughout the entire thing it's just empty nostalgia bait but then there's this one brief moment where Mathew Perry talks about how he felt on set a lot of the time, nervous about getting laughs, it's a little heavy and does bring the jovial mood down a bit, but it was actually something real. Afterwards, it's back to all the \"FUN NOSTALGIA EVERYONE!\" It was the one interesting moment in the whole thing.\n\nI'm struggling to find the clip on Youtube, there's another one that keeps coming up which is all cheerful and is from a later part in the special.",
            "In my experience, the best director‚Äôs don‚Äôt let their egos get in the way of a beautiful accident.",
            "Dude, nothing in that doc was real okay? Entertaining maybe, but there's nothing genuine or real about the Beckhams.",

            "He is rhe guy who dies of going back in time in lost.",
            "That‚Äôs what he tried to do. This is from David Beckham‚Äôs Hot Ones interview. He states the director wanted him out of the house so Victoria wouldn‚Äôt be influenced by him. Though he ultimately put it in the documentary, so I‚Äôd assume the director ultimately decided it was an authentic moment worthy of screen time",
            "Nah it influences the interview when loved ones are in the room with them during an interview. It makes it more biased with what you think is the method for less control.",
            "Well said.",
            "He tried? David wasn‚Äôt supposed to be there, but he listened outside the door then popped in. They had to stop it till he finally left the property. The director said next interview she was way more comfortable talking to him. \n\nIt worked as a character building piece but it also really messed up where Victoria was supposed to be talking with the director privately because she was uncomfortable.",
            "Documentary is just a style of filmmaking, it‚Äôs not more inherently ‚Äúhonest‚Äù than any other kind. The director absolutely is running the show, just like in every other similar media.",
            "I mean yes and no, a director always has control over the subjects because they are the one choosing to tell the story anyway. Like, the director can‚Äôt NOT control their subjects, it‚Äôs intrinsic. They could have cut this moment out but decided to leave it in. It wasn‚Äôt a live performance, they could have redone the take. The script itself might not be written, but everything that we are able to see and hear courtesy of the production crew, is a construction.",
            "That's... Not what a documentary is 99% of the time. From nature docs to political issues and band tour recordings, documentaries are almost always scripted and predetermined. Even small indie doc makers ask their subjects to repeat questions and retake their supposedly authentic and random activities. The authentic doc you describe has never existed, otherwise there wouldn't be directors making them. What you describe is CCTV.",
            "It‚Äôs put together by Studio 99, which is a production company owned by David Beckham in collaboration with PR experts. The whole thing is a construction to make him look as good and charming as possible.",
            "You think that how those work. Lmao. There essays thr director I'd allways tring to prove some point and the subjects in the doc are often used to prove that point. An exposesy is different",
            "Everyone‚Äôs jumping down his throat. That was his initial gut reaction. Not his current feeling on it.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/pquPK2bDJAI",
            "Because he didn‚Äôt create it. Artists are weird",
            "It‚Äôs the only moment of the documentary I saw. I don‚Äôt need to watch the rest.",
            "No idea why he would complain about it while also leaving it in the movie. If he didn‚Äôt like it he could have edited it out",
            "Tbf she did grow up working class but her dad did well. Class is about more than money in Britain.",
            "I‚Äôm not a football fan but when they talked about his first world cup and an entire country‚Äôs complete overreaction, it killed any interest in the sport.\n\nYeah, Beckham made the wrong play, but the unhinged vitriolic bullshit that 19 year old had to go through in the aftermath is an embarrassment on the English nation.",
            "He's a serial adulterer who took ¬£125m from Qatar to try to help them steer attention away from all the people who were dying due to atrocious working conditions building their stadiums. \n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/27/qatar-deaths-how-many-migrant-workers-died-world-cup-number-toll#:~:text=A%20Guardian%20analysis%20in%20February,the%20award%20of%20the%20tournament.\n\nHe's a piece of shit frankly. This documentary has gone a great job of white washing that it seems.",
            "Wasn't it the director's decision to put that scene in the documentary?",
            "They should hire you,...you seem to have a keen understanding of what will be viral before it becomes viral.",
            "It just means he was angry at the time. If he didn‚Äôt like it he probably would have edited it out.",
            "I agree.  I only knew about the documentary because of this. The guy should have pulled a chair and the pop corn and said ‚Äúthis gonna be good‚Äù but instead got angry. Dumbass",

            "Initially he was upset because they agreed to interview Victoria alone so she could be comfortable - so when David peeped in, Fisher was angry because he was supposed to be out of the house!  He didn't want to break Victoria's comfort or trust.  That's a good doc director.\n\nBut then he realized soon after that the moment eventually opened her up.  So he was angry at first, but obviously other things can change that and it made it into the series.  Also the sign of a good doc director.",
            "2023. It's nearly a year old now",
            "It's amazing how easy it is for documentaries to pull the wool over peoples' eyes. This is exactly what the documentary *wants* you to think of Beckham. But go look at the emails that leaked and the tantrum he threw after his charity work didn't garner him a knighthood.\n\nDon't be fooled, he's a wealthy, ambitious businessman not some down to earth dude who just happened to kick a football well.",
            ">Showed how down to earth, human and honest Beckham is.\n\nHe's not honest at all though. This is the guy who claimed he'd spent time with the LGBT community in Qatar and that they faced no problems there, in a country where homosexuality is illegal. \n\nHe had to try to put a spin on it of course, working for the Qatari government after building a large part of your brand on being a gay icon wasn't a good look for him so he just lied through his back teeth about it. \n\nOh also, don't worry about the 6500 migrant workers who died building the stadiums for the world cup, Qatar paid Beckham loads of money to tell you that wasn't a real problem either. \n\nThe bloke is scum. Doesn't need the money at all but he'd still sell his own mum for it. Can't respect it.",

She goes into this on it.\n\nAlso Mel B says there is a spice girl WhatsApp group - which I just love!",

They released an album without her that didn't sell well, they didn't stay together as a group much longer after that since the hype had run its course and most pursued some form of a solo career.

Either of those can be a statement, rather than an obsession.\n\nI bet it makes weddings damned uncomfortable, though. (Seriously, if you‚Äôd said that was the top of a wedding dress I‚Äôd believe you.)",

            "Ahh thank you! That rationale‚Äôs interesting. I guess I see what she means, but agree with you that removing a whole bunch of choices doesn‚Äôt necessarily make styling easier. What‚Äôs left might not actually be your fave items, right? If she‚Äôd said ‚Äúwhite is my favourite colour‚Äù I‚Äôd understand a bit better. Good for her anyway.",
            "It does seem to suit her really well as a colour & I understand the ease in terms of taking out all the choice & decision making once you‚Äôve realised what works for you. I often find a look or a piece or a cut that really works for me but then I can‚Äôt just repeat that everyday as I‚Äôd be wearing the same thing everyday? So I feel really stumped how to make my style work whilst still wearing different stuff. \n\nBut yeah in realise I don‚Äôt see how it makes life easier for her past the decision making point when it‚Äôs such a hard colour practicality wise! I guess her life is easier to keep things clean? I wonder if she still wears other colours behind the scenes though when she doesn‚Äôt have to maintain her look.",
            "She's rich enough not to have to clean her own clothes",

            "Yeah lots of people do it; the only difference is they (Steve Jobs, etc) tend to stick to black and she chose white. It‚Äôs why some people liked having school uniforms; easy to get dressed in the morning.",
            "Sure, it makes sense for the majority of things you may want to wear. But she sticks EXCLUSIVELY to white. I find that really odd. What would she wear to a wedding? A funeral? Out in the fields with the horses? (Who am I kidding, she wore all white to an RBR shooting weekend). At that point, the choice is kind of limiting and IMO stupid.",
            "I've known many people who take this approach. Baz Luhrman said he either has all the same things at home or has an assistant decide for him so he expends zero mental energy until he gets on set where he can just unleash all his creativity at once.",
            "I want to know what she does with weddings!!! \n\nI wear a lot of white but I know when it's appropriate and when to mix it up. It's very impractical.",
            "It kinda makes sense. Wasn‚Äôt she the other woman in her husband‚Äôs previous relationship? \n\nOr maybe it‚Äôs a way to show her wealth? She‚Äôs so rich she doesn‚Äôt have to worry about ruining her clothes. Or maybe she just likes the colour?",

But it was actually chlorine or some sort of pool chemical that had been put in a glass and her parents made her puke it back up.

            "So I looked this up and her mom was a hairdresser and she and Victoria‚Äôs dad founded an electronics wholesale business. So I can see them going from lower middle class to wealthy during VB‚Äôs childhood.  Kind of like Kate Middleton, she grew up in a mansion, but likely remembers her parents budgeting earlier in her life. \n\nIt‚Äôs definitely a thing you‚Äôre aware of as a kid, but I guess she‚Äôs being taught self awareness now.\n\nETA: he apparently did grow up working class, so I get why he was adamant about it.",

            "One thing about class in the UK is that it is not that based on income or wealth, but more cultural indicators. So the dad could have done well in business, but still be working class.

            "Thank you. -Closes door - is my new favorite way to make a point.",
            "Her getting driven to school in a Rolls was one of the reasons she was called Posh Spice. But at the same time, they are still working class because the class system in England is not about money but lineage.  AFAIK, Posh's family don't have a signet ring/family crest for one thing. (Neither did Kate Middleton's family - they had to make one up for her). \n\nGeri has poshed up a bit since marrying the Formula 1 guy, and she gets ribbed for it.  David gets ribbed for his whole country look too. And frankly so did Kate b4 Meghan.  \n\nThe English do not like it when the people start thinking \"above their station\".  It's fine to go down though -- which is why Harry and William speak Estuary English acents (I believe that's what it's called), rather than Received Pronunciation.  Kate used to get so much crap for her accent especially since none of her family including Pippa have it.",

That old adage of \"once a cheater always a cheater\" is not universally true. Some can be predisposed to cheating, but others it's very situational. Human's are not meant to be monogamous, that's more of a recent development thanks to religions.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I don't condone cheating, if you can't be monogamous you need to have an honest conversation with your partner about non-monogamy. If they aren't on board then it's cheating if you pursue it. So you have to make a decision about if you are capable of being monogamous or if you need to leave this person because your values do not align.\n\nAnd if you did cheat, for whatever reason, you need to come clean to your partner. It's that simple. Clean up your house, address the cheating, and address what it means for your relationship. You fucked up, you own that and fix it... or the relationship ends.\n\nEither way, it doesn't define your entire life. And I am tired of seeing so many internet social justice warriors trying to define an entire person based on a mistake from the past if they are obviously owning it and moving past it.\n\nHowever, after looking up this former alleged mistress. I haven't found any evidence that it's true. Only her claims. The Beckham's dismissal of those claims. She said they sexted... but I can't find anywhere those sexts were verified. The thing the tabloids are clinging on to now is Posh saying that that period of time was the hardest time of her life... which is true if he was cheating OR someone was making their lives a miserable hell by telling tabloids he was cheating.",

You're right that young kids don't really have a concept of how money impacts them, but kids who grow up wealthy have so many more unconscious advantages, to say nothing of being able to afford richer cultural experiences like traveling that aren't available to poor children and the advantages of things like healthy food and good insurance.",

            "Okay, real important shit:\n\nFrom a Marxist perspective, having expensive stuff doesn't imply that you are part of the working class or not, this is why the \"*communist with an iPhone*\" argument makes no sense to us. If her dad earned enough through his own work to buy an expensive car, he still working class regardless.\n\nNow, if his income came from the ownership of private property (means of production) and therefore the exploitation of other people's work, then we can say he was not part of the working class but part of the bourgeoisie class instead.\n\nBeing from the working class is not defined by what you own as personal property, but by the fact that you sell your work.\n\nFrom what I could gather, her father started as an electric engineer who later started his own company, making him a petite bourgeoisie, or someone who controls the means of production but still has to work on them. Which in the Marxist analysis is not the most urgent contradiction to be fought in capitalism.\n\nSo, that's a materialistic way to understand the situation. Having stuff, even expensive ones doesn't define one's class in a Marxist definition, since we don't use lower, middle, and upper class as valid definitions. You are ether proletariat, petite bourgeoisie or bourgeoisie!\n\nTherefore, if you want to become part of the socialist movement but think you don't belong because you got a PS5 or some other expensive thing, just ask yourself: \"D*id I fucking work to buy this shit?*\" and if so, there are no contradictions.",

There were even aristocrats.  The first goals of the Revolution were to throw off the vestiges of the Ancien Regime, which had allowed the country to basically come to the brink of bankruptcy, and to reform the nature of the governments involvement with the Catholic Church.  The revolution is better understood as monarchists/traditionalists/conservatives vs liberals.  There were various calls for liberal reforms to reduce wealth inequality, but there was no eat the rich campaign.  Later there were strands of proto-socialism, but nothing that was even remotely successful.   \n\n\nAround 30k people died in the terror, in which regime opponents or people accused of being regime opponents were killed.  The Terror followed the start of the War in the Vendee. That civil war, started by the aforementioned opponents of the revolution, would eventually see 250k people killed. It drove valuable resources away from more important things. Thus the government worried about fighting a second civil war in a different region and sought to round up its enemies. Not saying it's ok, but that's what happened.",

            "We, Marxists, don't make a moral distinction about types of work. Let's take an example of someone who most people agree is \"not really working\", a digital influencer.\n\nDoes this hypothetical person use their time and energy to produce something that society considers to be valuable? And does the only income that this person has come from this production? If so, the person is working class.\n\nNow, we can argue about the perceived value of work, and I can agree with you that a digital influencer, a soccer player, and a top-listed Hollywood star earns too much money, but all of those people are technically working class if their income comes only from their work.\n\nThis discussion, about how much people can earn from work, is a very complicated one, and there is not black and white solution. Of course, she had a very easy life that in no way can be compared with the lives of the great majority of working-class people, but the real question we should be asking is why she earned so much by doing what we can consider little while the rest of us earn shit for a lot of work.\n\nThe problem is that the perceived value of work in capitalism is always skewed into a logic of profit over practical value, and this is a contradiction by itself since profit doesn't necessarily translate to benefits to society, most of the time it goes the opposite way.\n\nBut now here is the kicker, she isn't the problem, sure, we can perceive it as unfair what she earns compared to us, but she is just the tip of the iceberg, the real problem is those who have private property and earn exclusively through its ownership, AKA billionaires, heirs, landlords, bankers, etc.\n\nThe deconstruction of capitalism within a socialist perspective is from top to bottom.",

            "There is a distinction in the UK though. They literally have a caste system. \n\nFor example, working class is DB‚Äôs parents.

Kate Middleton is middle class and her parents are millionaires and she went to the same high school as a literal prince, but she was still middle class.

            "At his best Rooney was better than any of them though ; 09/10 I think he was giving Messi a run for his money in terms of scoring until the ankle injuries. All around play was fantastic as well of course.",
            "üëå",
            "Worth reading the other articles on that site about his other books. Pretty funny!",
            "18??? wtf",
            "I've watched both play and both are great. Like I said, it's been half a season. Even Rashford had those when he looks like one of the best attackers in the world. Let Bellingham show consistency first.",
            "I guess you are right, did not take account of age there. To be fair though it is much harder to start in the City midfield, I would go as far as saying Bellingham would be on the bench for must win city games had he picked City. Not because he is bad - But because of how much time Pep takes to integrate players, and the presense of a certain Kevin De Bruyne.",
            "I think his point is that there‚Äôs lots of players who are just natural athletes who end up playing football but you could drop them into any sport or any event in the Olympics and they‚Äôd probably be good at it. \n\nI‚Äôm thinking of people like Pogba, CR7, apparently Phil Neville was an absolutely phenomenal all-round athlete as a kid and could have gone pro at cricket or distance running. \n\nRooney in the 400 metres or on a tennis court wouldn‚Äôt really fit.",
            "Hey bud you don't have to pretend that you get the joke, you can just smile and nod. Don't worry about it.",
            "Ok, what about this. You get a ball that has been absolutely pinged from right back. It bounces 10m away from you and is still traveling apace by the time you hit it. You hit it 30cm off the ground as it is coming down.\n\nIn that scenario there's not really anything different from if someone had just set you up with a \"pure\" volley from 10m away. Same technique, same speed at the point of contact, etc.\n\nOr, what if someone sets you up from 1m away with a nice lobbed pass that sits gently onto your foot. Technique-wise, no different from what Rooney did.",
            "Agree. I'm not comparing half volley to volley.",
            "When we lost 1-6 against Manchester City, half the team got disinterested, and he basically was playing Right Back. Well and Midfield and everywhere, never gave up.",
            "i said he has iconic moments too. Not gonna lie bro, a lot of those Ronney moments you listed arent iconic to any non united fan. Also, I said nothing wrong in my original comment, the fact its getting downvoted shows how dead football takes are on here",
            "I think any of them ‚Äúon their day‚Äù were arguably the best player in the world. The difference between those players and Messi and Ronaldo is their output just wasn‚Äôt as consistent. \n\nWas Rooney on his day better than Robben or Sneijder on his day? I reckon it‚Äôs fair to put them in the same bracket.\n\nRooney‚Äôs 09/10 season was absolutely world class though i‚Äôll give you that",
            "That's my point, Jude has been performing as one of the best at the club since he was at Dortmund. It hasn't been a short period but a few seasons. The only thing that's increased drastically is his goal scoring, but that's also come with a much more free role at Madrid.\n\nCole Palmer has been playing well for 6 months, and still not remotely close to the level of Jude.",
            "That‚Äôs less about their talents and more about what their bodies *look* like. Rooney is shorter and slightly stout, but he was quick, strong, explosive, and had great stamina and balance. He was an objectively great athlete in addition to being a sublime footballer, as were Pogba and cr7",
            "Damn you're super insecure. Calm down.",
            "No doubt some pure volleys will be easier to hit and less good looking than some bouncing balls. Roberto Carlos' strike against Tenerife is one of the best goals ever but it's not a volley, it's a bouncing ball. Maybe it's because I played tennis but I still stubbornly think it's useful to distinguish when describing the two types of strike.",
            "genuinely wondering if you've ever watched/played football before with the way youre discussing this issue. the situations you describe are completely different. any ball that bounces will have a much slower and more predictable trajectory than a pure volley",
            "My apologies!",
            "It‚Äôs a subjective opinion really, which would be heavily influenced on which team you support. There‚Äôs probably not a massive amount in it in terms of both players, but I‚Äôd personally say Rooney edges it because he‚Äôs won everything he could have at United.\n\nCredit to Aguero though for adapting his game to become a ‚ÄúPep‚Äù player, I think there was a chance his city career could have ended sooner but he made himself indispensable.",
            "If you look at Sneijder's career his peak was very short, it's basically 2 good seasons. He was struggling at Real at the age of 25, spent 3 years at Inter and then moved to Galatasary. His 09-10 was incredible but it's hard to argue that wasn't a bit of a purple patch in a career otherwise blighted by underperformance and injury.\n\nGiven you were making a point about consistency, I think it's unfair to group Sneijder with two players who actually were consistently world class and at the top of the game for 10 years.",
            "Sancho was performing at world class levels for multiple seasons at Dortmund too. Look where he is now.",
            "I do understand where you're coming from. There are different angles to look at the classification.",
            "I feel like it‚Äôs useful for helping a player or expert explain and practice these techniques, but in colloquial speech it just becomes unneccesarilly complicated",
            "What if someone sets you up with a volley from right next to you? That's as slow and predictable as it gets.",
            "I get where you‚Äôre coming from, although my main point was that none of them were consistently good enough to be in that top tier so Sneijder kind of typifies my point more than any other! \n\nMy main point was that ‚Äúon their day‚Äù any of them is as good as the other. Do agree that Sneijder had the worst career of the 3 mentioned though, but the reason for including him was the 09/10 season where he arguably should‚Äôve won the ballon d‚Äôor.",
            "Yep, which means you're world class until you're not. And currently Jude is and has been world class with more than a 6 month sample size.\n\nSteven Gerrard was world class until he played for the Galaxy, does that change what he did before he dropped off?\n\nNot really sure how that's relevant.",
            "That's exactly what I'm saying as well. 6 months of good football doesn't make you world class. Jude has potential to get there and will in all probability get there. Cole Palmer can get there too, you can't deny that either. But he hasn't done enough to be top 3 of all time like the original comment said."

And that‚Äôs not what i‚Äôm saying so let‚Äôs not get it twisted. idk them personally, and I definitely don‚Äôt know what their situation was like at the time (and i‚Äôm not speculating on how it was or is). But to think that most celebrities who are married are monogamous and live happily ever after is just not realistic. I think a lot of them have an agreement - ‚ÄúJust dont make me look stupid‚Äù (beyond the blinds) which makes sense. You do you sometimes, I do me, sometimes let‚Äôs bring it together lol. I think to be that kinda high profile you have to be very secure and independent in a lot of ways (not always ofc). You are constantly surrounded by some of the most attractive, successful, wealthy, possibly intelligent lol people. You have access to pretty much everything and everyone. The way the public reacted to Will and Jada saying they were Open is probably why a lot of celebrities stay quiet - because ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt understand‚Äù, it‚Äôs not a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù thing for us ‚Äúnormal‚Äù people to do but their job is kinda to not be?  Do I think ALL celebrities who are married have an arrangement?? no of course not, i‚Äôm sure there are tons who are happily monogamous! But I do think it‚Äôs more common than we think.",

I'm just calling attention to the rather dodgy way it was handled by the press\n\nEdit to add: If anything it's the impression that Victoria is just happy for him to do what he likes behind her back that I object to.

After being with my partner for 4 years, I finally realized that he is invested and supportive of our relationship *as long as it‚Äôs benefiting him*. This is different than actually prioritizing me and our relationship. There‚Äôs an underlying selfishness/self centered-ness that is the key difference here. Is he truly looking out for you, or is he making you happy bc of what you bring to his life and so it benefits him and he enjoys it?  The only sign of this I can think of early on in a relationship is if he‚Äôs empathetic or not. If he‚Äôs moving the world to make you happy, but you see that he‚Äôs not actually empathetic in general, then that‚Äôs for him not you.",

They will make you believe they are so in love with you.\nThey will make all of these promises for the future and deliver on none. \n\nBecause once they have you, your undivided attention, admiration, support, and love‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs when they start to reveal their real selves. \n\nThen you get the bare minimum, if you‚Äôre even lucky enough to get that. Then they see you as if you‚Äôre a threat to their autonomy.

            "Pretty typical if you've ever been married. The amount of effort you put in for a man who is head over heels in love matches the attempt to woo you. You think this is it, this is *your* person, you're a team. You happily cook for them, have their babies, put in effort to clean and remember the calendar and manage the home.\n\nThen the wooing gradually stops, leaving you with the work, which was \"never a problem before\". Now that everything is taken care of (by you) they are free to discover themselves, have fun, play golf, have kids-free nights etc while you hold down the homestead. You become boring and serious and not *fun* like you were when you met (because you're tired and overworked). Then they have an affair to feel like someone is \"paying attention\" to them again, to feel that spark with someone.\n\nDita von Teese was cheated on. Beyonce was cheated on. Jennifer Aniston, Halle Berry, Eva Longoria, Gwen Stefani. Marriage to a man does nothing for women except tax breaks and medical privileges. You will never be hot enough, talented enough, famous enough, beautiful enough to keep them loyal if they don't want to be. Vows certainly won't change that. And many don't want to be loyal, they simply want a reason to blame you for it so they can have you take care of every day labor, get their dick wet *and* not have to feel guilty.",

            "I'd imagine that one of the shittiest things about being Beyonce or Posh Spice is that the only men approaching your level of success, and who are therefore confident enough to approach you and suitable as partners, got there by being fanatically dedicated to their jobs and possessing narcissistic tendencies.\n\nNarcissistic workaholics can be middle class too, but you've got a much better chance of meeting and falling in love with a decent man who's going to value you beyond the honeymoon phase than they do.",

            "No. My husband only gets more thoughtful and doting as we age. You just need to find a partner who knows love and attraction aren't enough, the same way loving flowers isn't enough to maintain a garden. The appreciation, gifts, over the top genstures, etc are *for the person giving them*. It's a thrill to be high on another person like that. You feel like they are The Answer. And that's all it is. Unless it's translated into enduring respect and team building, it's not at all enough for a relationship to coast on long term. \n\nLove is choosing to do the work to grow, hold yourself accountable, be candid about your needs (and when they're not met) and develope the skills to maintain the relationship. It doesn't just happen. You choose to be the best possible version of yourself and support each other in the endeavor. Don't settle for less.",
            "I know good men who respect their partners in healthy, loving relationships over the looong term. but I also think there are certain types of kindness / ‚Äúkindness‚Äù that are more likely to correlate with men who are less dedicated or who are faking being nice (like insisting that a woman ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt have to‚Äù work‚Ä¶.while totally not respecting when a woman WANTS to work so the man doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúget to‚Äù do the ‚Äúnice thing‚Äù of supporting her financially aka holding all the power). So there are good men but there are a LOT of things in our culture that help disguise dangerous men as good men. The older I get, the more examples I gather of what to avoid. \n\nBut women really do need have healthy boundaries from the beginning to avoid getting enmeshed with someone who won‚Äôt respect her worth and boundaries later on. I personally struggle with setting and enforcing healthy boundaries, ESPECIALLY with men because I got so used to changing mysef so male partners wouldn‚Äôt leave me. so I genuinely don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs safe for me to keep dating men because that puts me in a situation where I can‚Äôt trust the man OR myself to not put me in harm‚Äôs way. Thankfully God made me bisexual so I can go look for a wife but I also learned how to live happily on my own.",
            "No, this is what life would be like if you choose to get married to a celebrity. \n\nI‚Äôve worked in the talent space for a number of years and famous people mostly don‚Äôt get famous by accident. They‚Äôre extremely driven, self-centered, focused on their careers, and have big egos that need lots of stroking. That doesn‚Äôt mean they can‚Äôt also be nice and respectful people, and many of them are, but a pathological need to be liked combined with extreme attractiveness and wealth means that a lot of opportunities to be unfaithful come up and there‚Äôs a lot of psychological need that those offers fulfill. There are people like this who are not famous, or even incredibly attractive or wealthy too‚Äî my ex was someone who needed an incredible amount of external validation and that was a big part of why he cheated. \n\nWhile I hesitate to say that my husband would never, because never is a long time, I think I would have to get to a place of extreme neglect in my relationship in order to even create conditions in which he would consider it. Not because I am so special or because he‚Äôs so great but because cheating goes against his conception of self‚Äî it would make him feel worse about himself, not better. That kind of obsessive love that David offered Victoria at the beginning burns out hot and fast and after that is when you find out who you‚Äôre really with. Do your best to figure out whether the person you‚Äôre committing to has values and priorities that run much deeper than however they feel about you in the current moment.",
            "It‚Äôs likely related to the class differential in their relationship. He‚Äôs working-class, whereas she grew up well-off.

Same applies to husbands who earn less than their wives. Crazy Rich Asians shows this very well.",

And maybe lots of women are attracted to money and power, but the richest men I could think of - Bill Gates, Elon Musk, and Jeff Bezos - are all divorced.\n\nI tried to explain that I look at someone who obsesses so much about money and careers as a bad partner, because you only get so many hours in a week and I need a man who will spend a lot of them with his wife and children, not trying to add another zero to his net worth.  You need enough money to live and prepare for emergencies and retire, but beyond that being super successful usually means sacrificing your life for your career.\n\nWhen the belt in our vacuum cleaner broke, my Dad took me and my sister to the store to get a new one, and let us help him take it apart and get the old belt out and put the new one in, and explained what all the parts inside were.

            "Part of the not getting comfortable is really being willing to boot them if they drop their side of the bargain. \n\nI love my partner - and I behave lovingly, because love is a VERB, not a feeling - but he knows, deep in his soul, that I will kick him out if he starts slacking without a good reason.  If he's sick or having some sort of issue, OK, no problem, I will pick up the slack.  But if he's lazy or starts letting things go because he's not taking care of his mental health, I can and have kicked him out.   Love doesn't mean you enable bullshit.   \n\nTo his credit, he strove to do better and has improved a lot and it hasn't been an issue for several years (he did majority of parenting for a while there, and we switch household and kids back and forth as our jobs picked up and ebbed).

And someone's willingness to sacrifice things to be around you in that circumstance is no more indicative of their long-term behavior than someone staying up all night playing on a new video game system is proof that they will never buy another.\n\nUltra-intense infatuation at the start of a relationship is a bit of a pinkish flag in my experience. Someone who is overwhelmed with thunderclap, throw-my-life-away-immediately feelings for you when they barely know you is susceptible to that with other people as well. His willingness to risk his million-dollar job and endanger the livelihood of his teammates and disappoint his fans in order to spend more time with her was more an indicator of his devotion to his own gratification than his devotion to her as a person at that early stage.\n\nI also don't think Beckham is a bad person- they were pretty young when they got married and they seem to have made a pretty good go of it all these years later. People can mature, and change. But I don't think looking at the most successful, attractive, generally desired people in the world and seeing that they get cheated on should make one despair. Because someone else's fidelity is not about whether or not you are able to forever remain objectively the hottest person in the room (you can't, nobody can) but based on their character. There are \"mere mortals\" out there in happy, faithful long-term relationships, and A-list stars and supermodels who get stepped out on.

And it's dangerous to put it in gender terms, and of course, we have male/male, female/male, and female/female relationships, so we shouldn't assume that this is just a problem with men, it's gender-blind.\n\nThe issue is, when the excitement wears off, does the relationship get better/stronger, or weaker/worse?

When they do that it means they have no idea what their partner is like in bad times until it's too late. \n\nI would never want to date a professional athlete or a famous person. The expectations for you as a partner would be insane and you would almost be assured that they're going to stray at some point. I would never compare a famous heartthrob sports athlete to the kind of people I date. The most my husband can hope for is that some woman at a conference or a work trip throws themselves at him after a work dinner. And frankly I've seen the women he works with, I'm not worried. And people cheat, both genders. It's pretty equal.",
            "just a perspective from a random dood, but i think this behaviour is more common in high profile individuals / athletes etc. i've read a few biographies of people like Schwarzenegger, Chris Hadfield, and other similar high-achieving types. the thing that i always came away with was that they never mentioned their families in their books (or it's just like a footnote-level mention). they talk about the work they had to put in, the meaning it gave them, hurdles to cross, the rewards etc, but absolutely no nod to sacrifices that others surely must have made to help them become successful, especially their spouses.  so i guess it could be something like these types of people directing their entire focus and energy into one personal goal at the expense of a balanced life. not judging them, it was just something that struck me as missing.",

            "I think a monumental point that seems to have been missed, is that both he and she, as in both of them, David and Victoria have denied the affair happened consistently from that time to the present. They've endured more celebrity gossip and tabloid fodder than most Hollywood couples who crumbled under much less. I have to say that should speak volumes more than anything else, should it? Kind of like bad trees won't bare good fruit. \n\nWas there an actual affair? I don't think it's responsible and more importantly fair to ones self to read into anything more than could possibly be known. While he may have made decisions without her input to go play football in a different country, they both learned right out of the gate of the crazy circumstances that come with celebrity lifestyle. The very lifestyle they both had chosen even if at first they didn't understand it fully.\n\nEveryone also has to take into consideration that the Beckham special, like the Arnold one and all the others before, are put together in a way to be very interesting, captivating and highly marketable. It's entertainment, while it can capture a good deal, it's edited together, like a great movie. \n\nMy take away - 2 extremely popular celebrities met 25 years ago. They had strong family values and shared a genuine connection and desire to be with one another. Despite ever escalating challenges they bore the weight, they stayed connected and fought to make it work, both of them at different times in different ways. They raised 4 seemly level headed kids despite all the craziness. Most of all, they seem not just to still love one another, but to still be in love with each other. \n\nYou never know how people truly are, I never thought what kind of people they may be. But they both seem genuine, down to earth and kind hearted despite having a combined net worth of 1/2 billion dollars and living through so much publicly created drama.

            "It can go the other way too. My best friend (who is a guy) got cheated on by his wife of 13 years (they have 4 kids together). She wasnt terribly good looking, but she lost a lot of weight after a lap band procedure and started going out all the time. Cheated with 2 different men. He hired a private investigator because she wouldn't be honest, then asked for a divorce. She moved out. When someone has a boost of self esteem and confidence they didnt have previously, they cheat. I have seen 2 other women get gastric surgery and do the exact same thing. My friend let her sleep in and did the school runs, packed the kids lunches, mostly made dinner etc, so it wasn't that she felt underappreciated, she barely did anything. He was far more a hands on father than she was a mother. They owned a business together and he did 75% of the work too. She, I also believe, married him for his family wealth and social status and once that novelty wore off, she looked elsewhere. She, I believe, took his niceness for granted and wanted a \"real man\" ultimately, based on standard social norms and conventions. She openly told everyone he was gay as to why they were divorcing because his actions in their marriage were considered not manly enough to the greater society. It made me sad that we are still dealing with these tropes, even amongst lay people (he isn't ridiculously rich btw, just his family has had a business for a few generations).",

It's not dehumanizing to look at the fundamentals in a non-romantic/non-emotional way.\n\nAnyhoo, to that point, some of these marriages started with online dating, always initiated by the woman. They all treated it like a job. They'd have 4-5 lunch dates per week. It was a numbers game. \n\nI just wonder who is socializing people this way, and how it's happening. I've just never seen it.

            "I mean I‚Äôm happy that you anecdotally don‚Äôt have or know any women with these experiences, but studies prove that there is a very real gender-problem phenomenon in dating and relationships (and tbh pretty much in all aspects of life, but I won‚Äôt cover everything because it‚Äôs just too much to include).\n\nJust look at the rates of domestic violence, abuse, and rape committed against women by men. Women are most likely to be raped or murdered by the men they‚Äôre in relationships with. The *number one cause* of death in the US for pregnant women is murder by their male intimate partner. \n\nJust look at the rates of unequal division of domestic labor and childcare in even ‚Äúegalitarian‚Äù marriages, when both partners work full time jobs and even when the women is *the breadwinner*. The number one reason given by women in divorce is ‚Äútrouble with traditional roles/lack of support‚Äù. \n\nJust look at the cultural and political backlash due to women‚Äôs emancipation from the home/traditional marriage and unequal dating/courting dynamics. Politicians are successfully repealing reproductive rights and criminalizing abortion left and right. They‚Äôre going after birth control and no-fault divorce next. Dangerous and misleading patriarchal propaganda for ‚Äúideal marriages‚Äù and reductive gender roles, from the tradwife movement to the manosphere, is *rampant*.\n\nJust look at the rates of men turning to *misogyny and male supremacy* as a result of not getting laid or struggling with dating. Women that have these *same issues* are not advocating mass rape or forced marriages, mass enslavement or repealing of rights, or mass violence or murder of men, so *what the fuck is going on with men?*\n\nLike, incels are literally considered one of the most dangerous domestic terrorist groups on the rise by organizations like the Southern Poverty Law Center and the National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism. They are considered male supremacists *and terrorists*. There is entirely a phenomenon of one gender being far more likely to develop extremely fucked up, hateful, and *violently deadly* attitudes and beliefs towards the other gender, based (allegedly) on dating/relationship dynamics.\n\nAlso, I have no idea why my comment makes you so sad. Are you projecting some tragic backstory onto me or have you just not been paying attention to reality?

But all these issues and discussions feel so omnipresent to me that I have zero clue how someone could not be even a little aware of them.\n\nI‚Äôve personally never had anything bad happen to me because of men.

            "Tl:dr: there‚Äôs a whole field of study called ‚Äúprimate ethology‚Äù that dissects different kinds of social groups that primates practice. ‚ÄúMonogamy‚Äù or pair bonding works very differently, in primates. Ethology has identified ‚Äúrules‚Äù that primate groups follow, from how social behaviors, over generations, affect body size, testes size, etc. There‚Äôs good reason to suggest that, no, humans actually aren‚Äôt ‚Äúnaturally monogamous‚Äù. (Edit: put this at the top). \n\nI think we should separate out the emotional and sexual aspects of monogamy here, and put it to one side. That‚Äôs not what @literaryqueenxx is addressing, if I‚Äôm following them correctly (and I‚Äôm pretty sure I am). I think they were talking about social monogamy, or the social pressures to pair bond for life. \n\nThey‚Äôve got a point! If you look at primates, pair bonding (which is rare, and only some species of primates do it) is all about reciprocity. It happens in species where the female is pretty secure, has her own hunting territory, etc. The male can share her space and help her patrol her territory and find food, and when they mate and make babies, their reproductive success (i.e., whether that baby makes it to reproductive age) is tied to the other partner‚Äôs success. So both work hard to ensure that the other is okay, and the pair are closely bonded w each other. They spend hours grooming each other, for ex; Titi monkeys sitting with their tails intertwined for ages, etc. Males are generally not much bigger than females, and it‚Äôs really hard to tell them apart from size, because there isn‚Äôt a lot of competition between males. Edit: pair bonds are *not* 100% sexually monogamous: both sneak off and cheat, but they come back. \n\nOther species of primates have completely different sexual practices. The shape that their social groups take depends first on exogamy: who leaves the natal group at puberty? For ones where the females stay in the natal group after puberty (and the males leave to find partners), those females maintain exceptionally close bonds with their matriline, and raise the babies together. Males then compete with other males for access to those females, so the males get bigger. You‚Äôll see this misunderstood in popular culture as males being ‚Äúdominant‚Äù over females. That‚Äôs not what‚Äôs happening. The males are fighting other males, and they get bigger when they have to compete - so size is related to competition *with other males*, not because being big and strong makes them able to overtake females. Females still have lots of agency: If the females don‚Äôt like the dude, the entire matriline leaves. \n\nThere are other social groups, where males that stay after puberty (and females leave); those groups are promiscuous polygamous. They include chimpanzees and bonobos, which we‚Äôre more closely related to. \n\nThere‚Äôs ways to detect what kind of sex and social groups primates have from their bodies, because what they do has consequences for natural selection. There‚Äôs consequences for overall body size, and also something called ‚Äúsperm competition‚Äù, a hypothesis that proposes a link between the size of testes and social group. Bla bla bla, there are consequences on the body. I‚Äôm not going to give a full overview of primate ethology here because it will take awhile to explain, and I think I‚Äôve already lost most people, haha. \n\nAnyways, if you look at human bodies, and apply these rules, we don‚Äôt look ‚Äúnaturally monogamous‚Äù. Rather, it‚Äôs a social belief of many human cultures (not all). \n\nSo separate out emotional and sexual preferences (which are culturally mediated anyway) with social monogamy, which works very differently, in reality, in the primate world. We‚Äôve lived in societies which, because of inheritance laws, very much promote the view that women are property, and their mating is to be guarded carefully. Our societies have followed suit, from the underlying economic and political systems that we‚Äôve made up around this premise. \n\nHumans have our own 5-6 million years of evolutionary history, so it‚Äôs not a hard and fast rule that this can be applied to humans - but when we do apply the ‚Äúrules‚Äù from ethology, and look at our own bodies, we‚Äôre left with the suggestion that actually, no- we may *not* have been very monogamous for much of that history. \n\nI am very much a serial monogamist, and I love that I am - but let‚Äôs be careful to acknowledge that culture very much promotes ‚Äúacceptable‚Äù sexual behavior, and often does so not because it‚Äôs good for us, but because it perpetuates the social order, and underlying economic systems. \n\nEdit: moved tldr up, and tried to cut this down a bit‚Ä¶",

            "I don't know what you mean by \"parsing semantics\". I suppose you're saying that I am misunderstanding the intended nature of this sub - that may be true. It has certainly changed from a much less radical place and maybe it has indeed become more of a women only sub. Interestingly, a couple months ago a woman was writing a very gentle and thoughtful comment here on this exact matter and she was also attacked (not as being in the wrong sub, but as being brainwashed and betraying her gender and whatnot) and her comment was removed.\n\n>Perhaps you‚Äôd understand that not all bears are a threat, but I‚Äôm certainly going to be cautious around one because you can‚Äôt tell immediately which are dangerous and which aren‚Äôt.\n\nAt no point was I arguing that women shouldn't be cautious around men. Or that they shouldn't expect every man that they don't know well to be dangerous and have bad intentions. *Of course* it's rampant enough for that. And of course it's systematic and ingrained in society.\n\nBut if \"most everyone knows it's not ALL\", then why insist on phrasing it like it was, when that's clearly offensive to those that you claim not to be talking about? Replace 'men' with any of the other demographic category and the problem is immediately clear. The bear analogy illustrates another issue - bears are a threat because they are bears, not because many individual bears are bad actors that shed a bad light on bears as a group. It's being a bear that makes them dangerous, it's their nature. No bear attacking a human does so because it's evil (probably). But every man that abuses a woman is an individual that chooses to do so knowing what they're doing is awful. It's not man's nature. Focusing on the sex is just taking away responsibility from every bad actor and dumping it on every good one.\n\nMaking a generic statement that concludes an attribute (\"doesn't speak with words\") from a category (\"male\") is always wrong and offensive. If the category is race it's racism and if it's sex it's sexism. But somehow the world being sexist towards women justifies (women) being sexist towards men. And if someone takes offense or points this out they are just part of the problem and toxic. Gender or sex just shouldn't matter at all for things that aren't related to them like how much somebody earns, what their opinion is worth or how they are treated.\n\nI don't know why I even put in this effort. Conversations in other subs sometimes end in the other person (or myself) agreeing that they were wrong when arguments have been exchanged, but not here. It probably really isn't worth it. The most depressing thing about this whole conversation is that people will always feel justified in what they're doing, even if it's *the exact thing* they are trying to fight.",
            "i only have one TV and it‚Äôs in my living room so the daybed makes movie nights and general lounging more comfortable for me as my apartment is a little too small for a sectional or larger type of couch. also it was more affordable (about $400 all in) while still being stylish! \n\nalso would be better for cuddling for the next time i‚Äôm ready for a male friend!",
            "It's fine to think \"heterosexual marriages are statistically bad for women so I simply won't get married\", but it's dangerous to think \"all heterosexual marriages are bad so I may as well stay in mine\", and I think some people definitely use that reasoning to justify staying in their bad relationships. FWIW, my dad retired early to stay home and be my brother's primary parent to support my mom's career too.\n\nIf women don't leave their shitty male partners, then those men have no incentive to ever change because they already get everything they want without putting in any effort. They get the benefits of being in a relationship, plus so much more, because men in equal partnerships aren't also getting an unpaid maid, household manager, and sex worker who only provides pleasure without getting any in return. (There's a reason sex work is work and must be compensated properly.) I get that it can be extremely difficult to leave when kids are involved, but if your husband is basically another child you need to take care of, then you're going to be better off without him anyway. Being a single mom to 3 kids is hard, but being a single mom to 3+1 kids is harder, especially if that last one is uneducable.\n\nI'm not saying it's women's fault that men are shitty, but rather, if you will absolutely not consider leaving no matter how bad the relationship gets, then there's no advice anyone can give you to improve things. If he's so shitty that he doesn't care that he's making you miserable, then no amount of additional misery will change his mind. I see this a lot on reddit - \"My partner is terrible in all these ways but I don't want to break up. How can I get him to change?\" The answer is, you can't. If he's not already doing it after seeing you in misery, he never will. People complain that redditors always tell advice seekers to break up, but if someone is sucking all the happiness out of your life and has no desire to change then what's left to do? It's not fair or right that he's doing this to you, but if he won't change then you're the one who must. If you won't break up, then at least end the status quo. Stop having sex with someone who doesn't care about your pleasures, stop cooking for someone who will never cook for you, stop cleaning up after the man child. Do the bare minimum you need to survive - do your own laundry, cook your own food, pay your own bills, and that's it. If he doesn't care about your happiness, you at least have to.",

It would take something big for me to really be done with him. We‚Äôve been together nearly 8 years now so we‚Äôve had our rough patches, mostly those couple of months that pop up every once in a while where you bicker over everything. But when you just really enjoy living life with someone, you‚Äôre more willing to work on things. Especially if they‚Äôre a good partner overall and they just have their moments.\n\nI would never forgive cheating, though. That‚Äôs a personal dealbreaker for me. It would just completely change the way I saw everything. I already struggle with trusting people so much. Weirdly enough I still understand Victoria not wanting to leave - if she truly loves his company, they have a family together, plus all that $$$‚Ä¶  again, I wouldn‚Äôt stay but I can wrap my head around it.",

            ">A LOT of footballers seemingly have cheated on their wives & girlfriends!\n\nIdk it's also really common for musicians to cheat on their spouses but something tells me if she had cheated on David Beckham, the world would never let her live it down. Look how people turn on Sophia Bush or Ariana Grande or Jada Smith - like even if Jada is so gross to be hooking up with a child her son's age, that's not really what people in general focus on as much as, you know, her cheating/cucking poor Will Smith - it's such a tired excuse that seems to only be available to men. \n\nI'm not criticising you here, just in general. The way we frame famous men cheating and the way we frame famous women cheating is so wildly different I wish we'd keep the same energy for all cheaters. \n\nAnd btw, I don't think she needed the money as much as she needed to accomplish her own personal life goals of having a husband, having a family, having a stable home etc that she probably felt was easiest to find with Beckham than anyone else. As other people pointed out, her family was actually worried about him taking advantage of her wealth at the time! So highly unlikely that was a factor to her decision making.",
            "I mean, when he raped a woman?\n\nEDIT: I mean I know he's been sanctified since he died tragically etc ‚Äî if he hadn't, the narrative around him would be very different today. But he was accused of rape, first admitted to having sex with the woman then had his PR slander her in the press, then settled out of court, and Vanessa showing up with that huge rock was definitely part of it. He did some good things, both for the sport and outside of it, using his status as an elite athlete, but he was also a sexual assaulter at the very least, and Vanessa choosing to stand by him through it is a very different conversation than Victoria taking back Beckham after he cheated.",
            "OH I completely forgot about the schoolteachers rumours, I was thinking about Rebecca (?) like, a decade plus ago.

It's all part of the same mindset. I say this as a pretty hardcore sports fan and don't mean it in a value judgement sorta way, but it's very telling the way so many male sports stars talk about the women they share a life with ‚Äî beautiful supporting characters ‚Äî compared to how they talk about teammates or coaches or opponents, who all get to be perceived as the main characters of their own lives.\n\nAnyway this is all to say. I'm sure Messi has a great marriage but I wouldn't be shocked if it came out he cheated either.",

As time went on people want their celebrities to be more relatable so she adapted hence the documentary the cutesy pictures if the family and them as a couple. I think she seems so phoney to be honest that if she truly didn't get over it or doesn't trust him the public would never have an inkling or clue.

Beckham was pictured hugging Eriksson‚Äôs former partner partner Nancy Dell‚ÄôOlio inside the church.\n\nEriksson‚Äôs coffin arrived at Fryksande church at around 7am local time, long before the arrival of any of the 600 guests who are expected to be present. A single bell tolled as his body was carried into the church.\n\nMembers of Sweden‚Äôs royal family are also expected to be in attendance, with roads surrounding the church in the small town where Eriksson grew up cordoned off by police.\n\nAmong those to arrive early were Eriksson‚Äôs father and children as well as a childhood friend of the former Lazio and Benfica coach, Bengt Berg.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm very happy and very sad at the same time,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs fantastic to see him returning to his first point. It‚Äôs a very curious feeling.\n\n‚ÄúHe‚Äôs one of us and we share his glory. But when he returned here, he was just one of the hot-dog eaters.‚Äù\n\nEriksson died at the age of 76 in August, eight months after revealing he had terminal cancer.\n\nBeckham wrote at the time: ‚ÄúSven, thank you for always being the person you have always been, passionate, caring, calm and a true gentleman.\n\n‚ÄúI will be forever grateful for you making me your captain.‚Äù\n\n**Full story:** [**https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2024/09/13/sven-goran-eriksson-funeral-david-beckham-torsby/**](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2024/09/13/sven-goran-eriksson-funeral-david-beckham-torsby/)",

            "The Netflix Beckham documentary handled this in a very interesting way. No-one flat out admitted it, but you can clearly see by body language, and the careful choice of words to all responses, that he cheated. They dealt with it and came through it, but it was not easy and almost broke them‚Ä¶",
            "TIL she is Piers Morgan's second cousin",
            "I offer Rebecca Loos the appropriate condolences for discovering that her married employer, David Beckham, was cheating on both her and Victoria?",
            "This man has always been a cheater and likely has never stopped but VB seems ok with it. I‚Äôm not enjoying the misogyny towards Loos second time around and yet again he‚Äôs not being held accountable for his actions",
            "She really thought a man who was cheating on his wife with her would be faithful? Girl...",
            "So he cheated on his wife with her and then she‚Äôs shocked he cheated on her too? Lmao I mean cheaters cheat girl and if you sleep with a married man you know is married, you‚Äôre not any better than him tbh,  sorry",
            "But, but, but David owned Victoria by making her say she wasn't working class!",
            "Going by a certain pro infidelity, infamous affair partner sub, this kind of twist is not uncommon. Rebecca says she felt hurt, distraught and shocked when she saw David \"cheat\" on her, and that's a common reaction because the affair partners on that sub genuinely act shocked when the dishonest POS spouses lie or cheat on them. Suddenly they get all the clarity and trash talk the guy, saying that they all deserve much better men than them anyways and it's their wives sad, but deserving fate to end up with such scumbags. \n\nThey gladly say that when an affair implodes or ends badly, the affair partner wins or is at an advantage because the wives, kids and the family have to carry on with the pain and heartbreak of infidelity or divorce while they get to start over fresh with a better person and don't have any bearings, relevance or reminders of the affair in their brand new relationship. \n\nThe worst is when these affair partners discover that these men are \"cheating\" on them with their own wives by sleeping with them. Apparently lying about a dead bedroom is common among cheating husbands. Affair partners are also awful, miserable people who derive a kind of sick pleasure from secretly one upping a woman/family/man who's done nothing wrong to them. Rebecca's description of how David charmed her into an affair is something very commonly seen with cheaters.",

Yes he had an affair which does not make him a good dude but it also does not make him the villain of the story. She was a willing partner.

I'm also sure no one forced her to have an affair with a married man, either. \nMysoginy is always a given when we talk about women but let's not pretend there isn't any towards Victoria too.

Both people I knew were turned on at the thought of that man hurting another woman (aka their wives) for them and tbh, that seemed to be their favourite part. It is truly sickening to watch someone in such blissful glee talk about how the man they‚Äôre seeing lies to their wife. But when it happened to them, they were upset that I didn‚Äôt care lol. People will go on about how misogynistic it is to say even one negative thing about female affair partners, but being happy and getting off on another woman‚Äôs pain being internal misogyny is rarely brought up. It‚Äôs ok not to have sympathy for someone like this. \n\nTbh there was no reason for this woman to pipe up again 20 years later- holding David accountable is none of her business, not her job and not her place.

Only she'd be complaining that he hadn't mentioned the affair and accusing them of trying to deny it happened. \n\nThe thing is. The Beckhams cannot win either way here.

            "This is more about people being together \"for the sake of it\" and the impact it has on their kids. It might make the adults happy but I've never heard of anyone who grew up like that express that they're glad that their parents stayed in a loveless marriage to keep their lifestyle intact.",
            "I have discovered the typical rules/marriages don‚Äôt work for everyone. I‚Äôm divorced now and not sure what I want. There is a part of me that is not sure I want to spend the rest of my life with one person but don‚Äôt want to grow old alone necessarily. I can see how people (especially with kids) can have unconventional relationships. I do think as someone who grew-up with parents who faught non-stop and made a very toxic environment for us kids, it would have been different if my parents loved each other but were not in-love with each other vs fighting all the time.",

            "I dunno man there‚Äôs a big gap between a toxic (which is bad) and loveless but productive relationship. Maybe it‚Äôs because my married parents had me when they were nearing 40 but I don‚Äôt recall ever feeling when growing up until even I was almost an adult that my parents were in ‚Äòlove‚Äô. They clearly weren‚Äôt physical. They enjoy eating out together and travelling for tourism together. But again, they would rather I come with them to further enhance their experience. \n\nThey are a good and collaborative parenting team who are friendly and quietly affectionate with each other due to longevity. However, I don‚Äôt see the extra affection I see in them when it‚Äôs someone they care about more than the world like their parents or kids or siblings. \n\nSo you could say it was a non-toxic but loveless relationship.\n\nI‚Äôm still extremely happy that I could take for granted as a child that I had both of them as a team behind my back. It would have broke me for years if they split when I was a kid. Does that mean they should‚Äôve stayed together just for me like they did? I dunno, but the consequences are clearly not neutral.",
            "Honestly, whether the Beckhams have an open marriage or not, I‚Äôve never ever thought of them as ‚Äúloveless‚Äù and ‚Äútogether for the brand‚Äù I‚Äôm such a long time fan and they seem to genuinely enjoy each other and their family.",
            "There‚Äôs no guarantee they‚Äôd find better relationships if they divorced or that their relationship with each other would be better if they suddenly had to navigate custody and other concerns. Again toxic couples shouldn‚Äôt be together but some people are kinda idealistic about ‚Äúbeing together for the kids‚Äù being some inherent evil.",
            "Divorce typically lowers the standard of living for both parents and forces the kids to shuffle back and forth for the rest of their childhood. Abusive/ high conflict relationships should be terminated immediately, but falling out of love seems like a bad reason to upend a child's life.",
            "Eh, your parents not having the best marriage but keeping the family intact can sometimes be easier to navigate for children than all the complexities that come with divorce.",
            "well yeah because her neck is covered by hair lol. regardless the scooter ride was already way inappropriate for a married man",
            "Someone asked this on the scientific parenting Reddit and for the most part kids are happier when the parents stay together. Children of divorce are worse off. I‚Äôm going to try and find it.",
            "This for sure! I think parents who get along well but are clearly not romantically involved anymore/have still found what works are totally fine. \n\nMy own parents are still married and my childhood was marked by pretty acrimonious, awful, violent fights with constant reassurances from my mother that they were staying together \"for the kids\". I think that's where this comes from - kids feeling like the weight of a toxic/bad marriage is on their shoulders. \n\nTotally different than \"we're not together but we'd just rather work this way so long as neither of us are actually unhappy about it\". Kids are okay with complex parental/family relationships, it's the part where it bleeds into harming them because it's dangerous that needs to be called out.",
            "I agree, it really seems like they like each other and have a good time together. If you've found a good life partner, why give that up? You can, in fact, have it all.",

Native speakers know *how* to speak their language to communicate/participate effectively, but often they don't *know* how. Tons of people, if asked whether something is correct/why something in their language is the way it is, will not be able to say more than \"it just sounds right/wrong.\" This is true in basically every language; the only difference you're going to find is whether there's a high standard of grammar education across a whole country. IME the average Syrian knows much more Arabic grammar than the average Egyptian, for example, and that's mainly about education - nothing to do with language itself.\n\nI (native English speaker) happened to go to a school that took grammar really seriously.

            "Honestly, this doesn't sound like he changed as a person at all (wrt the \"moving heaven and earth\" to \"casting aside\"). He sounds like someone who always puts what he wants first, regardless of those around him. He prioritized his relationship at the expense of his teammates, he prioritized his career at the expense of his relationship, and he prioritized getting laid at the expense of his family. This is consistent behaviour over his life.",
            "My dad was like that. Super ambitious career wise. Love-bombed my mom early on in their relationship, was super excited about having a big family with her.\n\nHe kept moving around for his work. During one move, my mom couldn't follow. He found a job across the country w/o consulting her. We had literally just moved into our new family house. Me and my brothers were at an age where we simply had to focus on school. So my mom didn't follow him. He cheated soon after, \"because she wasn't there to support him\".\n\nMen like that need a mother more than a partner. And the moment the \"mom\" is not there, they go out looking for a \"nanny\". Especially if they've never really been on their own and have gone from their family straight into a serious relationship, they simply don't have the stamina to emotionally support themselves.",
            "I‚Äôm immediately suspicious of OTT displays of affection because I feel there‚Äôs a direct correlation between that effort and how awful he turns out to be later lol. Maybe thats cynical and I know ~not all men~ but my most traumatic relationships have been with the guys who started off driving hours to spend a few minutes with me, spending a lot of money on me, etc. \n\nI actually warn my friends against it too and I‚Äôm almost always right.",
            "It‚Äôs the risk  you get with men like that. They are always looking for constant excitement, validation , and love. I remember the girl that had the alleged affair was an assistant and claimed Victoria was rarely home in Spain. Unfortunately, David didn‚Äôt resist temptation. Victoria has her reasons for staying.",
            "You have to find someone who wants to be a team. And you have to cultivate that together. It's possible but it's work. And then it's also great and something you rely on. \n\nBut in the same way your house and car need preventative maintenance, so does your relationship. But both people have to be willing to do the work.",
            "This is not what it is like being married to every man, though it is common for people to be more focused on relationship building and showing their best side earlier on in a relationship than they are later.\n\nThe situation with Beckham (and I didn't watch the documentary so I'm going on what you say) is unusual because wealthy, high status people conduct their lives differently than others. \n\nI've been with my husband for 36 years and he has gotten even more attentive and caring toward me as I've gotten older. He doesn't do it to \"win\" or \"keep\" my affection as those are eternally his and he knows I'll always adore him no matter what. He does it because he loves me and wants to make my life better as age makes me struggle more. The choice of person you share your life with matters a lot. Choose for personality/compatibility, not for looks or income or whatever superficial thing you may think is integral. In the long run, character will impact your relationship more than anything else.",
            "> This has happened to Posh Spice and Beyonc√© at this point, and I am just a mere mortal.\n\nCelebrity marriages are more volatile, not less. So I wouldn't assume that if it happened to them, a regular woman has no chance of finding lasting love.\n\nI'm sorry this happened to you. I don't think every man is like that. There are great guys out there. But it can be difficult to predict how a man is going to be 10 years down the line from the outset.",
            "Honestly the whole narrative saddened me because it‚Äôs so typical. The excitement and the chase in the beginning‚Ä¶ then being forced in certain circumstances, making sacrifices, then poof.

I'm glad he did that at the beginning of the relationship rather than bailing after years.",
            ">  This has happened to Posh Spice and Beyonc√© at this point, and I am just a mere mortal.\n\nIt is important to keep in mind that when people cheat it is never their partner's fault. It's not because we weren't good enough. They cheated because it is their nature. No one is beautiful all the time. Life will always have difficult periods. During those periods, some people will cheat and some won't. The key is to identify who is loyal and trustworthy early on. The only thing we can actually control is who we make ourselves vulnerable to.",
            "I‚Äôm so sorry you have experienced something like this, and this documentary has caused you pain. I‚Äôve been thinking about it a lot too.\n\nTo maybe ease your mind about future relationships little bit- this documentary was made to generate good PR for David and Victoria. Even if it paints David in a negative light at times, it still makes him look remorseful, introspective, and a man wise with age. Celebrities would not make a documentary that would make them look truly bad. The true situation is likely very different. The rumors and blind items about David‚Äôs cheating started while they were dating and continue today. I am sure they loved each other and still do in a way but celebrity relationships are so different from ours. Both of them were and probably still are constantly propositioned for sex. I can imagine lifelong monogamy doesn‚Äôt make a lot of sense for either of them, but the public LOVES a long term married couple. \n\nCelebrity marriages are more like businesses than actual relationships. The Beckhams continue to make so much money off their ‚Äúbrand‚Äù as a couple. \n\nThis is not to say that non-millionaire-soccer-playing-10 pack-wielding-men do not do what David did to Victoria in the documentary. They have nothing if not the audacity. I do think that it‚Äôs hard to compare normal relationships with celebrity ones, even if we do experience the same pain that they do.",
            "Priorities like children and the partnership of marriage are things that can really change the perception of a move.  It goes from aspirational, interesting and ambitious to daunting and nerve wracking - the logistics of which can't be achieved easily with one mind alone. \n\nI have the opinion that most men don't view marriage as a partnership consciously *and* subconsciously, but view it at the very least unintentionally or subconsciously as acquiring a servant, cheerleader or supporter.   For every ten men who overtly treat their wives as bang maids, there's another twenty who do so unintentionally or thoughtlessly.  Such is their privilege of being the \"default\" person.",

            "I think it‚Äôs important to differentiate between two different realities:\n1. There are men who love bomb you, put you up on a pedestal, keep it up for months to years only to pull the rug out from under you dramatically => trauma that your relationship either survives or doesn‚Äôt \n2. In a long term relationship it‚Äôs not always going to be sunshine, rainbows and intense passion/excitement for each other. That is, you‚Äôre going to have the highs and periods where you‚Äôre super connected and in love, and the periods where one or both of you is more distant - either because life stuff gets in the way, you get out of sync, one of you is dealing with something, etc.  During that time it can be lonely and isolating, you could drift apart to a certain extent - but then if there‚Äôs truly love at the core of your relationship, there‚Äôs a way to come back together, rebuild, reconnect and be stronger than ever.",
            "Don't take relationship advice from celerities. Especially a documentary that's heavily edited and/or scripted to make them seem relatable.",
            "This has been a pattern in my life - not necessarily love bombing but really going the mile at the beginning and ‚Äúlocking‚Äù me in. Then after a while just taking me for granted. I think men are designed to conquer, once they do, it eventually fades.",
            "The pursuit and conquest of beckham was probably his only goal. Once achieved, he probably realized quickly that he would be accountable and responsible for  all the lies he told her during the love bomb. Being a good husband/partner is work. Being a good father/parent is work. Being a responsible adult is work.\n\nMost people want the romance, the fucking, and the entertainment; they don't want the accountability, responsibility, and the work.",
            "He is notorious for cheating on her throughout their marriage and it's kind of an open secret that they have only stayed married all these years to protect their brand.\n\nIf anything, the Beckhams demonstrate what happens when you marry a man who has women constantly throwing themselves at him. Sadly, I don't think any man in his position would have stayed faithful for 20+ years of marriage.\n\nThankfully most of us will never have to experience what it's like to be married to someone like David Beckham, but I still think that the more conventionally attractive, powerful, and rich a man is, the more likely it is that he will cheat.",
            "I know it's not going to be popular here, but I used to identify as a man and was married to a woman who was a local celebrity.\n\nHer job always came first and I always supported her and put myself second. I always figured that she would do the same when I really needed support one day.\n\nThen that day came and she left me and we got a divorce.\n\nShe ran her life in such a way that there was never any room for problems outside of her job. Her stress level and commitments were always maxed out. When I really needed help, there was no room for me at all, she had always been married to her job and I had been to blind to see it.\n\nWhen you're married to someone who is married to their job already, you're never going to be the center of their lives. She was a kind and loving woman but she just loved her career more than she loved anything else, even though it took so much from her and me, alike.",
            "There are loyal men out there. They may not be as smooth as the love bombers though. I think making sure you are really friends as well as lovers is important. They also have to like strong women, and not worry about things like if she is more successful, etc. They should also have an ability to make platonic women friends, and to be appropriate with attractive women as the bare minimum. They have to be okay with you as a flawed equal, not a fantasy. They can be crazy about you and lustful, but they are not treating you like a trophy that they can replace. Make sure you don‚Äôt feel bought, I guess. \n\nMy husband isn‚Äôt perfect, he can be moody, but he‚Äôs pretty great as a human. In my husband‚Äôs case, there were less overt romantic gestures and more nurturing, more sharing the load. Things like: bringing me groceries in college, securing an apartment together, rather than flowers and champagne and sweet nothings.\n\nAnother example: I had cancer and we had a new baby. He had a new job and he managed it all ( job and first time parenting to a newborn) while I was in the hospital for a long time with complications. We also went through a dead bedroom phase afterwards due to the complications and pain, and he was very patient about it, only getting sad when I stopped wanting to cuddle because I thought it would lead to the sex I couldn‚Äôt have. I could have been better about acknowledging his loneliness, tbh. \n\nRecently, I even told him that I didn‚Äôt ever want to know, but if he did cheat on me during that time, I understood. It was a long dry spell. (He gets hit on a lot.) He told me in the sweetest, softest way that I never have to worry about that with him. Now I am chasing him a lot and he loves it. The other night he got tipsy and he started giggling as he fell asleep and he said, ‚ÄúYou really seem to like me.‚Äù I have to remind myself that he might not always communicate his anxieties to me, but I should be careful with his feelings. A healthy love is work even if it is also easy and warm.",
            "When they get comfortable, they no longer feel the need to work to get you. It‚Äôs a classic tale of loving the chase. \n\nI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a huge problem because I think atp, Victoria doesn‚Äôt really care if he goes or stays, she just doesn‚Äôt want to deal with the media onslaught that will come with a divorce.",

            ">is this what life will be like if you choose to get married to a man?\n\nNo, this is what happens when you get married to a super ambitious man who is arguably more into his career than he is to you.\n\nI don't know too much about the Beckhams, but as far as the Carters go:\n\n1.) Beyonce didn't become üåü‚ú®Beyonce‚ú®üåü until after she married Jay-Z, and arguably only because she married him. I don't know these people and I don't know anything about their relationship other than what they publicly present to the world but I'd be willing to bet money that at least during one of their arguments some form of \"I made you\" was said, from him to her, especially since:\n\n2.) She was 19 when she started dating a 31-year-old Jay-Z who at the time was arguably a much bigger star than she was. She's 42 now. Prior to that, she spent most of her life under the thumb of her father who was also her manager. \n\n3.) He's a street hustler from Brooklyn. If you've never met one of those types, let me just tell you that they are some of the smoothest talkers you will ever meet. Men like that can talk their way into and out of everything.",
            "Beyonce and posh spice are mere mortals too just like us, and not every man has David Beckham's stardom and money. That is not a guarantee that a man won't f you over, but that kind of f you money gives people a bizarre egotism to do anything.",
            "I watched the documentary too recently and it just seemed like everything revolved around David‚Äôs career. They moves were always difficult for Victoria but she just had to roll with it. \n\nI think men are very vulnerable when they lose their emotional support, which they almost always get from their wife mostly. Women can‚Äôt let the ball drop when it comes to being there for their husbands emotionally. Men seem to get really lost once that happens and they don‚Äôt think optimally.",
            ">is this what life will be like if you choose to get married to a man?\n\nFor some people, yes. For some people, no. You've taken like three examples and extrapolated them into a universal rule of male human nature. \n\nIn the case of David Beckham, I think *some* of the things (like being away from home a lot and not spending as much time with his family as they'd like) are kind of a predictable part of being married to a professional athlete or to most people with a hugely high-powered career. Like, that's kind of what you sign up for by marrying a professional athlete. \n\nOther stuff, though -- the infidelity and missing the birth of his child -- that's just extremely shitty of him.",
            "He was giving her, a \"tolerable level of permanent unhappiness.\" Look it up.",
            "> it looks like Victoria and him are in a great place now. They seem like a really loving family and he seems proud and happy to be a dad and husband.\n\nThis is pretty common - men finally wanting to be a husband and father late in life. But they know that they won‚Äôt get that life if they wait too long. So they become a husband and father early when they‚Äôre not ready and aren‚Äôt interested, just to lock a woman down.\n\nThe solution is to find someone who genuinely wants to be a husband and father, walk that walk and live that life, *at the same time they are asking you to do it.*",
            "The industry is also toxic and promotes all kinds of unhealthy behaviours - cheating, addiction, etc.  The music, entertainment and sports industries are not known for attracting level headed, even tempered people and being on the road around so much temptation and with volatile people is night and day different from most people's ordinary lives. \n\nAdd in controlling, powerful management teams and abusive practices and you have a recipe for chaos",
            "I‚Äôm glad I haven‚Äôt watched this yet because I‚Äôd have thrown my TV. I didn‚Äôt know he cheated on her, and now I‚Äôm livid. I always thought they‚Äôd done well as a couple and were one of the few who had made it. And I assume they‚Äôre still together, but fuck that. Another man who knew it was wrong but did it anyway. And missing the birth of his child? \n\nWomen deserve better than this.",

            "I really appreciate this post because, to me, when watching this documentary, I have a similar issue that keeps taking away from completely surrendering myself to ‚Äúliking‚Äù Victoria and David as a couple. I feel like there‚Äôs a constant elephant in the room that isn‚Äôt being adressed: his cheating, which makes ‚Äúthe loving couple‚Äù trope seem a bit disingenous. Quite contrary, I feel like I‚Äôm watching yet another tale of a woman who chooses to lie to herself in the name of her husband. \n\nFor instance, their denying the Rebecca Loos cheating ‚Äúrumours‚Äù (I still have an episode to go, but read that they deny the affair). Come on, are you kidding me?! Of course they had an affair, and of course Victoria knows, and this ‚Äúunited front‚Äù scares the s**t out of me, watching women lie to themselves and for their husband in order to 1. keep up some weird facade of what married life is like, 2. hold on to power, which being married to a man like him probably feels like and genuinely provides, and 3. probably to protect their brand and spin a certain ‚Äústrong couple‚Äù narrative which this documentary really excells at. Let‚Äôs not forget that by ‚Äústanding by her man‚Äù, Victoria throws another woman under the bus. If that is not a patriarchy soldier at its finest, I don‚Äôt know what is.\n\nIt reminds me of two things: a scene in The Crown where Elizabeth (Claire Foy edition üôå) visits a female friend who does the then shameful thing of getting a divorce from her cheating husband, and you can see Elizabeth being completely torn; she is furious with Philip who of course cheats all the time. What do you do? Do what society expects of you, accept your cheating husband and bury your own pride and sense of self, AND keep your place in the social hierarchy, or do you expose the hypocrisy and go your own way, disgraced in the public eye, but free and with integrity?  \n\nThe other thing is a scene from the Wayne Rooney documentary where his wife and him are talking about him cheating and what it did to their marriage. And the wife keeps repeating: ‚ÄúI have forgiven him‚Äù, like she is trying to convince herself, or she wants to follow up with a ‚Äúbut‚Äù. I wanted to scream. What fresh hell is marriage for a woman?! Watching her forcefully trying to convince herself how FINE she was in the name of marriage, and yes, patriarchy, was excrutiating. It‚Äôs like, ‚Äúthis is the deal when you marry, you get access to a certain social standing and level of power through your husband, so you better suck it up‚Äù. And to see these women just gaslight themselves like there‚Äôs no tomorrow makes me think that they accept the premise; they don‚Äôt WANT to give up access. \n\nSomeone else here wrote that some men need a mother (or the nanny when the wife is not there ‚Äúto support him‚Äù), a pacifier more than a partner. That is exactly the vibe I get from Rooney, Philip and Beckham, and it saddens me that these systems are kept in check by women too (though I‚Äôm not shaming them, I just find the dynamic absolutely depressing). You could do a Shakira and just leave, it IS possible. Also, for me, this spinning of a united front narrative actually takes away from their brand, because it seems inauthentic.",

            "Anyone consider that maybe these two do actually really love each other and the family that they created together. David is a high achieving man and goes through things like any other human but at a greatly magnified level. Victoria understood that in a way that probably few other women can or will want to because she also shot to huge fame really young. They both seem to have strong family values and it sounded like they went to counseling to work through things at some point. I see a man that is growing, reflecting, taking responsibility and a woman who is still in the process of healing but what seems to keep them going from my humble perspective is the love, friendship, commitment and understanding. All marriages have big challenges at some point. Let's do a documentary on the average person's 20-30 year marriage and you will be shocked to see what they have endured together, what they have overcome to get to where they are today.",

            "As some people have already commented, I love David individually, despite his imperfections...and I like Victoria, although I find her less relatable because nothing she did demonstrated even a fraction of the tireless effort and hard work that David put in to have his success. But Victoria has a positive and feisty energy about her that I admire. Regardless, they seem to have very little in common as people. I do believe they were in love as younger people, and maybe they bonded over both having been celebrities. I think it would be very hard to be in a relationship with David, personally, as it is being with anyone who is such an obsessive perfectionist and workaholic.",

That doesn‚Äôt mean that women can‚Äôt cheat. \n\nIn my entire family, no one ever cheated and being Asian, it‚Äôs looked down upon.  Once you marry, you marry forever.

            "Where is this Documentary?",
            "Whoever wrote this has no idea of how football works. Victoria married David knowing he was a profesional footballer. She knew him transferring clubs was a possibility, just like David knew tours and traveling were a part of her career. \n\nManchester United WANTED to sell Beckham, he clearly would have rather stayed with his boyhood club. David had fallen off with his manager, Ferguson never liked Victoria and what he perceived she brought to David‚Äôs lifestyle. \n\nThat being said, the club wanted him gone. At the time David was one of the best and most valuable footballers in the world, so it‚Äôs very unlikely that United would have sold him to another english team that would compete with them. \n\nBeckham had 2 options at the time, since very few clubs outside England could pay his transfer fee and wages, both teams played in Spain, Madrid and Barcelona. David had few options and little to say on the matter, so he chose Real Madrid. \n\nBeckham cheated and yes he is 100% responsible for that, but Victoria has some blame in my opinion. She knew him moving was part of his career and she took over a year to move in with the kids. They probably knew he was going to move months before it happened. So the excuse that it was because of their kids school was bullshit on her part.\n\nNo way in hell she took over a year to find a suitable school in Madrid, a city as big as Madrid haves plenty of good schools that are bilingual at least. Football clubs are also very accommodating so if she was struggling to find a school the club would have most likely helped. \nSo even if it‚Äôs Davids fault she left him alone in Madrid for a whole year. She didn‚Äôt support him as a spouse. She chose not to move in with him. Plenty of footballers move clubs and their families follow them without a problem.\n\nAlso her career by that point was dead, there was nothing holding her back to move to Madrid, they have recording studios in Madrid. That being said, David was selfish when he moved to Milan on loan, that move was him changing his mind on what he had agreed with Victoria and also what he wanted for his career. It was a desperate attempt to make the England team for the World Cup and a moment when he wanted to have his cake and eat it too.",
            "If David really prioritised his career over his wife that man would've never been sold to Real Madrid. He was too into his wife, the coach saw that and sold his a**. This narrative that David put his career first is completely false anyone that knows football (basically no one on this sub/r) knows David SHOULD have been the best. Despite what we saw in the docs true football fans know he should've been better.",
            "He is narcissistic. He love bombed her. Spent hours and hours on the phone, bought her lavish gifts, then of course, he cheats multiple times, even while she was carrying his child. David has behaved this way consistently, I do wonder why Victoria stayed.. was it really for the kids? Family? Image? Or was she just so deeply in love with him that she accepted his poor behavior? I don‚Äôt know.",
            "This is a great take. It's hard to see when you're the focus of his attention, but this is the real red flag you should probably look for.

I invited him in and I could tell he really really wanted to. But, he said, he had promised his friend a ride to the airport. Could he go drop him off and then come back? Honestly I gave him props for it. I liked that he didn‚Äôt blow off his friend just because he was really into me.

I observe my friends who \"started big\" in their most failed relationships, all big gestures and flowers and show-off attention, only for the chaser to suddenly go cold or pull away without any reason. Or to devalue them by saying mean things or play cheap games. They did exactly what Bob Marley said: \"The biggest¬†coward¬†of a¬†man¬†is to awaken the love of a woman without the intention of loving her.\" My friends' most successful and best relationships were the ones where the man showed genuine interest, but didn't resort to grandiose gestures from the first period of the relationship. And then both sides gradually opened up, shared thoughts, feelings, their past, and came into a mutual embrace. And then love also grew between them.  \nI have to say, however, that only one of the latter relationship types ended in marriage for my friends; it was for the one who is 29 years old and it emotionally very mature and values her good man a lot, while also being treated like a queen. The other two broke up saying it was \"too boring for them\" and one of them missed her abusive ex so much (I guess her brain had become dopamine-soaked from the narcissist ex). However, those two are only 25 years old now, so maybe young to still believe in that breath-taking rom-com romance where you find your other half by instantly falling in love and showered with lavish gifts and super attention.",

Jay-Z pushed drugs in the streets of Brooklyn to survive. Being with Jay-Z definitely influenced her career and her musical direction, especially as she backed away from mainstream pop.

Even though her musical fame has far exceeded anything he ever accomplished, these two were never going to split after he cheated.

            "NOPE I'M NOT LISTENING LALALALA YOU CAN'T MAKE ME SEE IT",
            "I'd throw in Cesc",
            "3 times actually. One for United and one for Everton, both against West Ham. And then one for D.C United.",
            "Alonso did it twice at Liverpool",
            "There are quite a few players who have achieved it nowadays. Also I think there is a distinction to be made:  was the keeper up for an attack or was he just standing too far ahead of his goal? If you only count the latter, it narrows it down quite a bit. If you count the former, the most impressive of them all is from the Bundesliga imo. Moritz Stoppelkamp scoring agains Hannover, from a distance of 82 meters. We won‚Äôt see that repeated any time soon.",
            "I actually prefer Rooneys goal at West Ham to Beckhams because it was a half-volley and he had amazing anticipation, with less time to think and set himself. But Rooney wasn't in his own half\n\nRooney; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTjfMV0LCkQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTjfMV0LCkQ)\n\nBeckham; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raLRd9Z6SrQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raLRd9Z6SrQ)\n\nKane; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaJrXe6dOcI",
            "Yeah,both  against West ham. Alonso did it twice for us as well. Suarez v Norwich is my favourite though as doing a hatrick of hatricks against the aame club is ridiculous, but to complete it by doing it from the halfway line took the piss.",
            "Really good but still just a friendly",
            "Most aesthetically pleasing has to be Stankovic vs Shalke for me. A young Neuer with a diving header clearance only to see Stankovic connect with it on a volley from the halfway line and send it straight into the net. [Link](https://youtu.be/nRQRyrg7Xxw?si=jIe-MZnVIoClvwfr). Granted it's from just inside the half but still gorgeous technique.",
            "It sounds unlikely, but then you have to remember that prior to the 90s teams tended to play with a sweeper between the defensive line and the keeper, which made it less likely for keepers to be off their line.",
            "I only started watching in the mid-2000s, but maybe it's because goalkeepers didn't come out as far in earlier times?",
            "Yes, but it‚Äôs a game played mainly in autumn, winter and spring, so the ball was wet most of the time.\n\nI think you‚Äôve got the wrong end of the myth - the ball was as light as today occasionally, but usually it was wet and heavy.",
            "OK then not technically heavier but because of the materials used it didn't bounce as much, didn't swerve as much and was much harder to kick a distance. All of which would also happen if it was heavier, so no wonder it seemed heavier.",
            "One of those against West Ham was on the volley as well which as far as I know has never been done by anyone else.",
            "can still picture harper flapping on the floor like a fish out of water",
            "> We won‚Äôt see that repeated any time soon.\n\nWe get the occasional goal kick go in to be fair",
            "Yeah I mean that one is just next level insane. Not to mention it happened 20 seconds into the game.",
            "Not in Britain, that was viewed as continental football that was only very, *very* occasionally dabbled with.\n\nKeepers weren‚Äôt as high up as they are now in the top teams, but they did roam around their penalty box.\n\nI think people just hadn‚Äôt thought of doing it, which is why there have been so many since. It was a genuinely surprising thing to see at the time, whereas now it‚Äôs a thing.\n\nDoesn‚Äôt make it more physically difficult, but it was the imagination to try it which was so surprising at the time.\n\nWhether it was the first one or not, who knows? It certainly felt unique at the time. But not because everyone played with sweepers. Teams didn‚Äôt play with sweepers in Britain back then.",
            "I know Britain has a reputation for being rainy, but it's not sensible to say that the ball was soggy and heavy most of the time. And that's before considering that football is played worldwide, in climates drier than ours.\n\nThe key misapprehension in the myth, though, is the belief that the ball was heavier when dry anyway. People tend to say the ball was especially heavy when wet, but the assumption is implicit.",
            "I was thinking Stankovic vs Schalke but he was further forward\n\nstill one of my favorite all time goals",
            "on the volley to complete the hat trick. what a player",
            "Yeah but I‚Äôd say those are a completely different category. That‚Äôs just pure chance, there is no intent to score a goal. It‚Äôs always funny when it happens, but it‚Äôs more similar to a botched cross going in.",
            "Yet Inter still lost",
            "So it‚Äôs very often rainy when the games played, but it‚Äôs not ‚Äúsensible‚Äù to think the ball would be wet when used? That‚Äôs not very good logic, especially when you look at what the pitches were like at the time.\n\nAnd what people who actually played at the time say.\n\nI think you‚Äôre demonstrating the modern misapprehension, not explaining it away.",
            "That one was much closer, but quite possibly the best goal from a technical difficulty perspective.",
            "Yeah! After Neuer came out to clear a ball with a header",
            "That Stankovic goal is such a great one. \n\nEven Zlatan would be proud of that goal if he scored that.",
            "Yeah crazy to think Schalke was in CL semis just a decade ago",
            "I said Britain has a reputation for being rainy. I should have been explicit: reputations can be exaggerated and should be doubted. My point is that it's not raining as often as all that, even in a land as supposedly wet and miserable as ours.\n\nAs for the misapprehension, which I stated is that the balls were heavier when dry? Beats me why you think I'm demonstrating it. \n\nI hope we don't drag this out any longer.",
            "My dad used to talk about this actually and how the ball wasn't heavier most of the time .. but it was the laces that really hurt your head.",
            "I‚Äôm happy to bow out with the observation that, if you don‚Äôt think the winter weather in Britain is predominantly wet, then that says everything about your assertions, really.\n\nYou want to come up with a new take, and so are ignoring reality."

            "All I can think of when I hear the name Rebecca Loos is when she was on a reality show and had to masturbate a live pig.",
            "I love how they STILL skirt around this with the ‚Äúalleged‚Äù. It wasn‚Äôt just loos either there was another woman before her who had texts. Loos also claimed he was cheating with a model too.",
            " There‚Äôs something about Victoria Beckham I like, I don‚Äôt know why I think I feel sorry for her and the hate she‚Äôs had from tabloids and people picking apart her body constantly and moaning that she doesn‚Äôt smile.",
            "Those texts were definitely David, he is very lovey dovey (emotionally needy). One of the most stand out things he always says in this doc, is how he 'NEEDS' his family around him at all times to be emotionally stable.",
            "Since this is a Beckham post\n\n>\"I had a lot of conversations with the LGBTQ community when I was there... They felt it was the safest World Cup they'd had for a long time.\"  David Beckham says he was 'proud' to be an ambassador for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar\n\nOh fuck off.  Oh yes the \"LGBTQ community\" felt safe in a country where it is illegal to be homosexual and if anyone wore any type of rainbow anything or supported the LGBTQ community they were forced to remove it and when they would not remove it or wear it again they'd be sent to jail.",
            "It‚Äôs the first time in years I‚Äôve heard of Rebecca Loos again. I remember the affair big deal back then.",
            "Let this be a lesson: you can starve yourself and be the epitome of beauty to some people, and your dumbass husband will still cheat on you ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",

            "their PR is incredible bc i‚Äôve never heard of this and i‚Äôm a top-tier hater",
            "I met someone who worked for his PR agency at the time. She said they would sue at the drop of a hat about any small thing. She said the silence over Rebecca Loos was very telling.",
            "Do these two even like each other? I‚Äôve always wondered‚Ä¶",
            "This was a great doc - just finished it. But overall it made me dislike him lol he‚Äôs selfish AF man. VB is too good for him üòê",
            "As an American, I didn't know much about David Beckham back in the day other than he was this supposedly super good-looking soccer player who got Posh Spice pregnant (I looooved the Spice Girls). By the time his cheating came out in the early 2000s, I was in college and not paying attention to celebs. DB came back on my radar recently because he's British royal adjacent, and I follow the Royals. He seemed like a really down to earth, nice guy. \nAfter this watching this documentary, I think the guy is full of sh*t. He won't admit that shaving his head/going for a bad boy image was to rebel and piss off his coach. I highly suspect he allowed his management/PR team to leak the story of him getting hit in the head with the cleat and was all too willing to go along with their plan to wear steri-strips over the cut to make it seem much worse. And him calling out Victoria on where she was going and the type of car her dad drove... ?! She should have poked her head into the room and said, 'Hey, remember when you f*cked all those women at the beginning of our marriage?\"\nI feel that David Beckham has spent the last decade (at least) crafting this image as a down to earth business man, family man, and kind husband, and it's a crock of sh*t.\nAs far as their marriage, I do believe they loved each other very much at the beginning, and, likely, at different times throughout. After watching this documentary, I don't doubt that they are best friends and have mutual respect for reach other,  but I question if there's romantic love and if they are really \"obsessed with each other.\" The release of this documentary has been mutually beneficial as VB just launched a new perfume line - scents named after places where she has a special memory with David. (50mL for $200)\nI think their marriage and both their images have very much been 'stage managed' since the early 2000s, likely the result of him being caught cheating.",
            "I totally forgot about this. Even though I‚Äôm American and live in the US, I haven‚Äôt heard of Rebecca Loos in a long time.",

Especially when said person is famous you‚Äôre just opening yourself up to the hate and scrutiny. Unless of course they got like unfairly fired or something.",
            "It‚Äôs their private business, they don‚Äôt owe an explanation to anyone. It irritates me that people think they have a right to information",
            "Did he ACTUALLY have an affair or is this girl full of shite?",
            "There were 3 women at the time that were linked to him. Then there was that school teacher story years later.",
            "Cackling at the sext messages üòÇ. What an idiot",
            "I had a housemate who worked in Conde Nast, Vogue, and everyone knew David had affairs but because Victoria has a good relationship with the editor and British press, anything about affairs never got published.",
            "Is it strange that they never interviewed David and Victoria together at all throughout the documentary? Also, Posh was pretty much pissed at David the whole time lol so sad but can be so real",
            "It‚Äôs a common and widespread rumour that David Beckham is a serial cheat and has a little bachelor pad and he makes men/woman sign NDAs before he invites them back. So much smoke",
            "People are saying he still cheats ongoing. Is there evidence? I don‚Äôt see Victoria being ok with that.",
            "No idea why this nugget needs to be rehashed other than to get press they wouldn't get and sales they wouldn't get.",
            "I really couldn‚Äôt care less",
            "They still love each other very much. He has a big dick and great in bed the women have said. Those affairs happened 20 yrs ago but I‚Äôm curious if it still happens‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt see Victoria being cool with that.",
            "I was disappointed but also not surprised they didn‚Äôt go into much detail about the affair.\nI think most of us are of the belief that it did happen.\n\nReading some of the recent accounts by Rebecca, I can‚Äôt help but think David is a bit of a POS.\nRebecca obviously did the wrong thing. But it looks like he may have had a history of this behaviour, and I don‚Äôt think he respects women.\n\nRebecca said in the midst of their affair she then found him with a Spanish model at a Ronaldo party. Might not be true? But I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised. And apparently he was showing her texts to friends. Stuff like that just makes me think he uses women.\n\nI do wonder why Victoria stays with him.\nI wonder if their marriage is more a branding/image move.",
            "Victoria is just too skinny and it kinda looks like they don‚Äôt have much of a spark anymore and he just looks like he‚Äôs bored \nShe looks so awkward in the latest posts of them dancing or spending time together no closeness or warmth",
            "Yeah but it‚Äôs very clear that it happened üòê even the way they are asked about ‚Äúthe rumours‚Äù is vague at best‚Ä¶and David‚Äôs answers are cagey as hell. They tip toe around it way too hard for it to have been fake news.",
            "They do though. It‚Äôs clear in his reaction of pain and remorse. He doesn‚Äôt deny it but also doesn‚Äôt go into the private details. He doesn‚Äôt make excuses because there are none.",
            "Ugh üòë",
            "Omg. You sent me down a real rabbit hole! I just read [this](https://www.thefreelibrary.com/THE+BECKS+SEX+SCANDAL%3A+DAY+8%3A+THE+TXT+MANIAC%3B+Beck%27s+messages+to...-a0115220957) and wow lol. I can guess what‚Äôs been starred out but are there non-censored texts anywhere?",

            "Man Utd were paid ¬£25m and he wasn‚Äôt warned it was happening until it was a done deal. \n\nNo matter how financially well off people are, to have your life uprooted without notice has got to be difficult.",
            "I didn't saw the movie, but i've been a huge fan. I mean if brooklyn didn't make me dislike him, nothing would. But i think it was more about how things with Man United ended. And especially with Sir Alex.",

            "> they talk about a move to Spain as if they were stripped of their humanity.\n\nSeriously, it's not like they were being sent to a labor camp out in Siberia, lol. I don't understand what was so bad about Spain? They have money to take care of whatever they don't like. You don't like Spanish food? Hire a British personal chef to make your fucking salmon, that's what she eats everyday anyway.",
            "Yeah, no, I still side with her tbh. She had two young kids, was probably going through it because pregnancy does a number on your body and she has always cared a lot about her looks, she had to uproot her kids to a foreign country with a different language and have them stalked by press. Being rich helps, ofc, but uprooting children is always hard.",
            "More like 3-4 hours",
            "Full disclosure, I'm from the US and have never been to Spain.  Isn't Spain like... culturally very similar to other European countries?  Like decent work life balance, healthcare, at least somewhat progressive?  Also she complained about the food?  I would fucking love some genuine Spanish food.  And this is probably the American in me but Spanish is NOT a difficult language to learn enough to at least get around.",
            "There‚Äôs a football context to this which you probably don‚Äôt care enough to appreciate. Imagine being told to fuck off by your mentor. They‚Äôre too dramatic about it but I mean celebs gonna celeb.",

            "She was really darling in the reality show she and David has years ago. Maybe it was all an act, but it seemed to me that she let her guard down and allowed her real personality to shine. \n\nI won‚Äôt go so far as to say I‚Äôm a fan of her (or her husband, for that matter) but I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs a terrible person by any means.",
            "i met her once and she was nothing but kind. talked to me like a real person which can be rare for celebs",
            "She seems to be genuinely self-deprecating especially in older interviews and has a fantastic dry sense of humour. I‚Äôm an Aussie and I feel our sense of humour runs more similarly to British than American, she‚Äôs genuinely very funny and sounds sincere/down to earth. Definitely don‚Äôt agree with all her life choices but I would listen to any interview of hers!",
            "Yeah I remember as a kid I didnt like her because she never smiled in the tabloids and seemed kinda mean/boring but a few years later as a feminist teen I read that she just doesnt smile 'out of a duty to fashion' or something and I dropped my irrational dislike after that. She is charming and funny in interviews",

            "In all fairness he said that's the safest world cup, not that they feel safe in day-to-day life in qatar. I assume it's because\n\n1. Football and lgbt don't mix. Football is a \"masculine\", \"macho\" (yes, i threw up in my mouth using this word) patriarchal mysoginistic sport. I mean, even women who play football are victims sometimes... well, we remember what happened with spain's coach. That's how awful that world is.  I mean, one of the biggest football players has to have a fake gf and ivf made kids to hide that he is gay. And i'm sure he isn't the only one. There have been events when a football fan was beaten up at a stadium because he is gay. Or at least derided and made fun of. Hooligans are the worst. \n\n2. Since lgbt situation in Qatar is well known, and has been posed as an issue during the WC, the authorities have been extremely alert to not have any incident happen. Not for anything, but it would've cost them money and sponsors. So probably that's why they felt safer at this world cup than other world cups when violence against gays wasn't exactly an issue for the organizers.",
            "I thought so. When it first happened, they denied it, called her liar  and she said she was willing to go to court because she could prove it. Something to do with knowing something about his body that only people who had slept with him would. \n\nAnd suddenly they shut up and tried to make it go away by ignoring it and acting all loved up in public.\n\nIt seems so strange to bring it up again",

            "A lot of celeb/wealthy people have the \"business marriage\", it's hard to know if some of these couples are together for such a long time just because it's convenient since their marriage is also a brand (a la Beyonc√© and Jay-Z) or if they truly love each other as spouses first.",
            "I think their marriage is real but its also a brand. He supports her fashion line financially and she turns an eye on his cheating. But they have a family together, so whatever works for them.",
            "After watching the new Netflix documentary I think she loves him, but I‚Äôm not convinced he likes, let alone loves, her.\n\nHe‚Äôs very passive aggressive towards her. It‚Äôs subtle but it‚Äôs there. I think Victoria Beckham is more intelligent than him, and he knows this and resents it.

I think there's an alternative universe where Becks and Fergie have a heart to heart and he stays, and the transition from the '99 squad to the 07 team isn't as hard (with Scholes injury and Keane leaving suddenly Becks would have been great to have around)\n\nBut Fergie came off better out the two by far",

            "Back in 2018 when she thought she had clout.  Now she knows she‚Äôs a joke (jam and dog biscuits).",
            "I honestly don‚Äôt think David exacted revenge with Earthshot. This would suggest that he was still bothered and I can‚Äôt see that being the case at all. Harry‚Äôs position was made clear at Invictus and like a grown up, David moved on. It‚Äôs always been clear that David is pro-royalty, so his support of Earthshot is simply that.",
            "I'm liking David and Victoria more and more",
            "She's really dumb. She really thinks people can't reciprocate in kind - aka do the same to her as she does to others... wait for the Beckhams were racist pr leak as she tries to clamour this one back.",
            "The Beckhams have worked for their success & are Still close to both sides of their families, complete opposite of the Suckess‚Äôss  respect for the Beckhams",
            "She blamed Victoria Beckham for leaking to the press, when Meghan herself was the one *doing the leaks.*  Was this to save face with Harry?  We all know she leaks to the press 24/7 every single day.  Harry has to know this, but perhaps back then‚Ä¶Harry was pissed and she blamed Victoria ü§î",
            "To me, what is pure evil is not inviting them to the evening reception when they lent MM their Beverly Hills home prior to the wedding, supposedly so MM could get stuff done without prying eyes. She is a complete user.",
            "David Beckham, probably: not my loss.\n\n\nseriously, who is Meghan Markle (and Harry, as he is now) in the world of David (and Victoria) Beckham?",
            "It's precisely why Markle and her husband are getting... markled.",
            "Beckhams have more clout.  He is extremely popular.  He has some miss steps. Like the tax stuff. Hence no title. When he played at Man U there were always stories about what a decent fella he was.  Would make sure that he signed all the autographs for everyone who wanted one. Always nice in public.  Gary Neville lives near me and you would come across Becks in the local supermarket.  Whereas MM believes that her so called talent makes her popular. When the reality is that no one cared until she married H.  The story that  blows my mind is that Becks flew to Australia to meet H and he blew him off.  The sheer audacity of that.",
            "Harold will never have any relationships with other people while he is with the old hag.  If harold hasn't learnt yet it is all about her not him or anyone else.   She doesn't like it when others are more powerful, popular and richer than her.  Oh she gets so jealous it isn't funny.",
            "Why is this retaliation? We don't go to where we're not wanted. That's just being sensible. Such sensationalization is unnecessary.",
            "I really hope one day the Beckhams corroborate all of this. Its long past time people spoke up about this evil witch.",
            "Meghan Markle is insecure, and carries a massive racial inferiority complex chip on her shoulders.",
            "This woman has destoryed all of Harry‚Äôs friendship and Harry still hasnt woken up about her. Everyone can see she is the problemm. He is so blinded by her. He never wake up about her.",
            "Can I just say that Tom Bower is the gift that keeps on giving. üéÅ",
            "I don't go much on the title every time I hear money,sex and power my mind goes to the vallow daybell trials. Probably just me though, but on topic this about markle doesn't surprise me at all",
            "She misjudged  the power of the Sussex title in Cali.  She thought she was more powerful  than the Becks. \n\nShe was wrong.",
            "Just my opinion - I get the impression that Markle felt threatened by Victoria. She was self-made (with a huge fan base) who successfully married a talented sportsman. Like them or not, they‚Äôre successful, admired, wealthy etc etc..everything Markle desires. She had an option of using Victoria‚Äòs ‚Äòfame‚Äô (which I think she did early on‚Ä¶wearing Victoria‚Äòs wardrobe etc), but then I think she knew she was out of her depth, she didn‚Äôt belong - Harry was their friend, and she was an outsider, so she had to intervene‚Ä¶and we know how that ended up‚Ä¶\n\n‚Ä¶actually, it‚Äôs got me thinking. There were rumours of David having an affair (many years ago, but well publicised), so I wonder if it‚Äôs occurred to Markle that David may be easily seduced? Have there been any rumours of Markle flirting with David (similar to Serena‚Äòs husband, Alexis)? He‚Äôs certainly wealthier than Harry (and better looking)!",
            "If I remember rightly, William & Catherine were booed by the Americans during a basketball game. They handled it pretty well. \n\nDavid, turned up unexpectedly to support them. The relief on Catherine‚Äôs face seeing a friendly face was palpable. David is a good friend to have.",
            "I love that this is coming out.  MM's jealousy knows no bounds. I mean for someone to lend you their mansion, their actual MANSION, and you turn on them like this.",
            "Harry had friends before he met Meghan.  He has zero friends now because his wife poisoned every relationship in his life.  Nacho is the one exception but that seems transactional and at the whim of his volatile, grudge-holding wife.",
            "This tale of pathetic behaviour was also in Revenge. That book was so full of awful stories about MM, essentially laying out how she became the shameless and entitled creature she is, that it blows the mind. And Bower keeps clear of some of the rumoured things we all believe to be true and that are the worst of the worst.\n\nI believe she is more than severely disordered, I believe she is mentally ill and that both she and Hazmat are imperilled. \n\nPlease don't get me started on those poor children. Oy. Vey.",

            "I bought the book and it is apparent Tom Bowers loathes the Beckhams but what I get out of it is ILBW hates them because they have been able to do what she cannot.  Make money being famous for being famous.  Sadly This One is not hot like DB and even VB is not as a narcissist as ILBW,",
            "VB had enough evidence to go full blast Wagatha Christie on the bitch from Montecito.  Madame was never important enough for the Beckhams to be bothered with that.  G\nHowever their revenge has instead been slow and utterly complete via Tom Bower.",
            "I'm not sure I buy that Beckham was trying to take revenge on them by going to an event with William and Catherine. Beckham has been a monarchist for a long time.",
            "I'm glad this article doesn't incorrectly claim that Ripple of Hope was the same night as Earthshot, as Bower's actual account suggests.",
            "I don't know if Tom mentioned in either book the big fact and problem that Meghan had a rage against the Beckhams as she saw them not only one upping them but also taking attention away from her.¬† I read that somewhere.¬†¬†",
            "Of course she did the wife as him by the short and curlies",
            "I know this is who she is, but I would have thought she would have love bombed them for a while since they are such a power couple. I‚Äôm so curious her reasoning for‚Ä¶wait, I forgot, she has none. Never mind.",

            "I just have to Laugh at these two!",
            "The witch destroys everything good in Harry‚Äôs life. She needs to maintain control over him at all costs. The Beckhams were nice to him and don‚Äôt meed him. They are netter than Meghan by a chasm !",
            "She's cold blooded and ungrateful too, because the Beckham's had allowed her to use their LA mansion in 2016, to host her parents for Thanksgiving.",
            "Just call her Sekhmet.",
            "It‚Äôs her MO. It is pretty clear she was the impetus for Haznobrains to ditch his family too. She lead him astray. He said he was excited to give her the family she never had. Those are not the words of a man who hates and wants to ditch his fam. She poisoned his mind with the victim mentality and that she was suicidal if he didn‚Äôt give them up for her. There are some Markle apologists (*cough* PR people *cough*) that fight against the idea (*cough* gaslight *cough) that Markle is not capable of such things and that it was allllll his idea. But she has the track record of ditching family, friends, spouses, and he doesn‚Äôt. He actually had friends. Her friends are transactional business partners she ditches when no longer useful. Having said this, he is obviously not completely innocent in all that‚Äôs happened.",

            "I was always indifferent to her- Spice Girls were more my daughter‚Äôs thing, although they were fun - but I heard Victoria interviewed on a radio show and she was so sweet! She was funny and engaging, and she said she hated her smile, which was why she always had that serious look in photos. Since then I‚Äôve followed her career. She‚Äôs lovely. Once again I am disgusted with MM.",
            "Mostly indifferent, but starting to actively like.",
            "Agree! The documentary was very illuminating - I was interested in reading Bower's book, but based on the reviews, it's a bit nasty and petty, so I'll be giving it a miss. It says a lot that the only section getting publicity is the bit about the Sussexes, so the rest of the book must pretty empty of interesting content.",
            "Because she had always been a bully with other small frys, or docile men or her father who all gave in to her.",
            "Let MM try it. David is good friends with dozens of black footballers and Victoria was in a girl band with Scary Spice, an incredibly famous woman who happens to be mixed race. There has never been a hint of racism with any Beckham - ever.",
            "Like Posh has nothing better to do than dial up paparazzi about Meghan Markle. And Meghan was shocked that being married to Ginger Dunce didn‚Äôt make her more popular than David and Victoria Beckham.",
            "She is so stupid no one ever believed that Victoria would leak to the press. Meghan has been doing the leaking from one day and yes Harry definitely knows it. He is so stupid and dumb.",
            "The idea of Posh needing to leak things to the press for any reason. She's got more money, fame and connections than almost anybody, her personal brand is fully established. She doesn't need to play games with the press.",
            "I'm convinced she did the same w/convincing Harry that William/William's office (aides) or 'Palace' was leaking...it's completely possible that they were 'leaking' or at minimum off-record 'briefing their principal's side' in Tiaragate or whatever.\n\nBut I'm sure Meghan was responsible for pressing accusations that the palace was leaking/briefing against them, to Harry. Where some of the 'leaks' were likely Meghan herself.",
            "Entitlement. They invited ppl from Sentebale who turned up to find they were only allowed to stand outside the church. Some of Hairlesses friends weren't even invited to the evening. She really thought all she needed to do for doors to open was to invite ppl she didn't even know. Like her character wouldn't matter because I'm guessing she thought they were all as shallow as her. She brings nothing to the table.",
            "The ingratitude is Incredibly shocking. And how stupid to alienate such a powerful couple.",
            "She may have been jealous of VBs success - she didn‚Äôt need to find fame through a man. Sure David has helped their brand.. but VB was independently successful. \n\nWhat i am pretty sure is.. Meghan would have taken great joy in snubbing the Beckhams and Harry‚Äôs long time friends. She‚Äôd have loved that they weren‚Äôt invited to the evening reception and taken great pleasure in rejecting his friends. Whilst inviting Clooney and James Corden, Idris Elba. ( People she doesn‚Äôt know.)\nShe would have enjoyed the power of sending a clear message that read: fuck off and good bye. \nShe‚Äôs a c* nt. ü§î",
            "And strangers go to the reception like George Clooney. She is so shallow.",
            "that was so rude and ungrateful - David and Victoria were/are famous and she was an unknown before marrying Harry",
            "Harry is an ungrateful man child who‚Äôs always had the palace clear up messes for him. Now that he‚Äôs clumsily trying to strike out on his own we see what a sterling job  Buckingham palace had done. Glossing over Harry‚Äôs many many short comings. \nBut Harry still thinks he knows best. That‚Äôs the problem with being raised with zero accountability. He treats people like trash. Easily discarded irritating and disposable.",
            "don't think they'd bother doing that - it's in the past, they took note and moved on",
            "they are definitely not commenting on anything related to Bower's book, it's unauthorised. Plus, the Beckham/Sussex rift has been rumored/written about for years now.",
            "I think he has woken up about her. He has to have been in the devaluation stage since they moved to the US. It‚Äôs just that he is So stuck with her. All the crap he pulled on his family they will never trust him again.",
            "Imho, one of the biggest flaws in their desertion scheme is they believed their titles would rank/link them higher than anyone in the US except the POTUS.  Epic fail.  Some celebrities Might have seen them as equals here in the US, initially, but that failed quickly.",
            "I mean, Harry was close to Catherine too, M was jealous of the female competitor. Same thing. So she broke Harry away from Catherine and away from the Beckhams.",
            "This was clarified some time ago by several of those that booed.  They weren't booing William and Catherine.  They were booing a small group that had just showed up amongst them in shirts supporting their opponent.  William and Catherine were heavily applauded. Let's not forget the Thousands that lined up outside their hotel to greet them.

The Kennedy family, for example, used to be sacrosanct. It was nauseating the free pass the Kennedys would get, regardless of their behavior. Teddy Kennedy retained his senate seat in 1969 despite being involved in the death of Mary Jo kopeckne and had OBVIOUSLY lied about it. I once made a joke about JFK having been a massive womanizer and my friends acted like I had just disparaged their dads. Thankfully, the younger generation is less blindly loyal to that family.",

            "But also I think they call it 'coercive control' in UK, it's an actual domestic**He** abuse crime. Or psych/emotional abuse in the US. Or manipulation, narcissism.   \nThe thing is the abuser is *so believable* because they come across as **believing their own story.** Maybe some do. Maybe some narcs convince themselves.   \n**In the case of the parachute attempted murderer for his wife's life ins (UK) where the husband removed parts of her parachute,** not only did he flirt with the policewoman to try and get advantage, he was so scary her superiors told her not to be alone with him--& she was an experienced officer of many years. *Then from prison he attempted to manipulate his (in process of divorcing him) wife.* He was able to get inside her head, basically, and wanted 'more of her time, more of his (v.young) kids' time.' She says in the TV program (it was a UK program so I've only read summary) that she now recognised what he was doing and just cut off all contact.   \n**These are often very smart people, the parachute lady was an expert physiotherapist as well as parachute instructor.** My cousin, also miles ahead of Harry in the brainy department, was also eventually killed by her estranged husband. *They begin with love bombing, grooming, knight in shining armor, etc.* It doesn't stay nice like that. But it tends to blind even smart people to remember that time and blame the bad actions on 'he's just having trouble at work, her Dad's giving interviews, she's stressed, she's such a good mother/took care of me so well/supported me against people who hurt me'--that's entirely more rational when it's emotional/psych/financial abuse. The parachute wife, for example, said her husband had never hit her. But there are criminal laws against coercive control for this reason--a person could get arrested for beating you up, but not for being an asshole. Coercive control, like that Meghan has over Harry, is a specific pattern of manipulation, lies, and asshole acts adding up to abuse. \n\nNONE of this means that Harry isn't responsible for every bit he's done. He had, and has, more resources and options than 99.9% of other victims. He has his own funds, he flies around the world by himself. He's not physically isolated. He was able to call his therapist after the dog bowl fight w/William. He, along with W and C, founded a mental health charity.   \nI'm speaking only to Harry's mindset, and how he can 'buy in' to what Meghan tells him (SHE's not the leak, someone else--an enemy--is the leak). It makes it far easier for Meghan to do this because of Harry's deep paranoias from his own mental health problems.",

            "They did NOT boo William and Catherine.  The media covered this a long time ago, when they interviewed 3 people that booed.  A small group of people in opposing shirts walked into a group of Boston fans.  THAT is what was booed and THAT is why it was just a small handful of people that booed.  I will point out again, thousands of supporters for Wiliam and Catherine showed up at their hotel.  SO many supporters showed up that William and Catherine decided to do an impromptu walk outside to greet ALL the supporters.  As for the Kennedys, just as with Diana and Harry, as more and more info came out about the Kennedy family, their fall from grace began.  I'm most definitely not part of the \"younger generation,\" and I have Never, Ever been a fan of the Kennedy family.  He was absolutely a massive womanizer and came dangerously close to creating a nuclear war.  JFK was seen only as a \"hero\" because he stopped the nuclear war he almost created, he spoke out on civil rights, and, like Diana, died tragically young.  This immortalizing \"celebrities\" as some type of saint just because they die young and/or tragically is ridiculous.  JFK wasn't even President that long!  For some reason all their \"sins\" get over-looked just because they died young.  (Sorry, I have a serious pet-peeve about that, especially in regards to JFK.)",

            "Har √• sett denne avdanka fotballspilleren promotere disse i reklame p√• diverse sider og har ikke helt skj√∏nt koblingen.\n\nAt fyren sikkert har en velfylt bankkonto og tar seg bra ut kobler jeg ikke helt med promotering av hodetelefoner. \n\nAt Beats har f√•tt en Kardashian til √• promotere seg er ingen overraskelse. Men vil for meg personlig gj√∏re det enda mindre aktuelt √• kj√∏pe dette merket. \n\nN√•r det gjelder hodetelefoner s√• er merket og promot√∏ren for min del underordnet. Ser p√• pris/kvalitet/lydkvalitet etc opp mot mine preferanser.\n\nSt√∏ykansellering er litt vanskelig √• teste ut n√•r man pr√∏ver i et butikklokale. S√• her m√• man nok lene seg litt p√• upartiske tester. Men merket og hvilke influencer som promoterer dem kan jeg ikke bry meg mindre om.\n\n\nFor en god tid tilbake n√•r Beats var hypet opp kj√∏pte jeg motvillig et sett med Beats Pro by Dr. Dre til kj√¶resten. Tor hun ville ha dem pga pris og immage. Tror hun automatisk trodde h√∏y pris = bedre. De var tilsynelatende bygget som en tanks med mye aluminium. Men synest de h√∏rtes latterlig ut. Sikkert ok om man bare h√∏rte p√• hiphop.  P√• sikt viste kvaliteten seg √• v√¶re laber p√• alt som ikke var aluminium. Padding p√• ramme og puter flasset av. For en plas soppunder 4000 kroner kunne man nok f√•tt et bedre produkt om man hadde satt markedsf√∏ring og utsende til sides.\n\nHar ikke testet nyere B&W eller Beats st√∏ykanselerende hodetelefoner. S√• aner derfor ikke hvordan disse er.\n\nHar etter utallige timer med bruk/misbruk ikke klart √• ta livet av mine Jabra 85h. Og til tross for at st√∏ykansellering ikke holder helt m√•l mot nyere modeller har jeg v√¶rt forn√∏yd med disse. Liker lyden da den er relativt n√∏ytral, og ikke er s√• basstung som f.eks Sony. T√•ler og en del juling og til tross for √• ha noe som ligner et stoftrekk t√•ler de en del vann (IPX4).\n\nBose synest jeg er ubehagelige i lengden. Apple er un√∏dvendig stor og dyr og ser latterlig ut med den \"bleien\"  som man skal tre over for oppbevaring. \n\nOm jeg m√• kj√∏pe nye i n√∏r fremtid s√• aner jeg ikke hva det hadde blitt.

Alternativt er det ogs√• s√• simpelt som at det kan assosieres med kvalitet, ikke fordi personen kan noe som helst om produktet, men fordi forbrukere g√•r ut ifra at en s√•pass kjent person med s√•pass mye penger naturligvis bruker \"bra produkter\". \n\nGanske rart √• tenke s√•nn mtp at de f√•r betalt for √• bruke produktet, men det er alts√• en tankegang som eksisterer\n\nOm jeg ikke husker helt feil s√• var det Rolex som startet hele trenden med \"ambassad√∏rer\".

I noen av testene fikk de vite hvilke alternativer som kunne komme, og der var det s√• og si ingen av de selverkl√¶rte audiofile som klarte √• differensiere Monster-kabelen til 50K vs. en kleshenger. I en annen test ble lyd spilt inn over kabel, og s√• ble folk bedt om √• bestemme om ett av lydklippene var bedre enn de andre, eller om klippene var like gode. Der var det flere som likte kleshenger-kabelen, men det var noks√• n√¶r normaldistribusjon.\n\nObjektive tester som frekvensrespons og -konsistens viser at kleshengeren er d√•rligst, men foruten et par frekvenser s√• er marginene p√• st√∏yen s√•pass lav at det er helt umulig √• h√∏re forskjell n√•r det er musikk som avspilles.\n\nN√•r det er sagt s√• finnes det absolutt gode og d√•rlige kabler, selv digitale. Standarder som HDMI og USB er ganske rigide, og spesielt n√•r kabler blir veldig korte eller lange s√• vises det veldig godt om noe er av d√•rlig kvalitet. HDMI p√• ca. 10 meter kan virke helt fint p√• en TV, siden mottakeren klarer √• rette opp signalet og takler at hver 1 og 0 ikke er helt perfekte. Mens p√• en annen mottaker virker ikke kabelen i det hele tatt, og du f√•r bare sort skjerm eller et bilde som flimrer av og p√• konstant. USB-kabler som er kortere enn 30cm har en tendens til √• st√∏ye mye, s√• hvis de ligger n√¶r hverandre kan enhetene kobles inn og ut. Skal du koble p√• en SDR eller lignende, som trenger sv√¶rt h√∏y kontinuerlig overf√∏ringskapasitet, merker du ogs√• fort om kabelen ikke henger med. Jeg vil derfor anbefale √• styre unna det aller, aller billigste r√¶let hvis man har behov utenom det vanlige, men de dyreste kablene er nok aldri verdt det.",

Dette var en foresp√∏rsel p√• bare et par bytes. Forskjellen der er at USB-kontrolleren p√• kretskortene ikke takler USB som g√•r alt for langt unna spec, og kablene var rett og slett s√• d√•rlige at data ikke alltid kom fram, og st√∏y smittet mellom de pga. n√¶rhet og d√•rlig terminering. Vi ogs√• trodde at det ikke var n√∏dvendig med s√¶rlig gode kabler, siden det var lav b√•ndbredde og lenge mellom hver overf√∏ring. Men der tok vi smertelig feil.\n\nVi skulle kj√∏pe ca. 1000 stk. s√• vi testet dyrere og dyrere kabler til vi fant noe som endelig virket, og s√• kj√∏pte vi 1000 av de. For kabler p√• ca. 20 cm m√•tte vi ut med 120kr per stk. for noe som faktisk fungerte.",

            "Ja, den er jeg med p√•. Men det at utnyttet vs. tilgjengelig b√•ndbredde er det eneste som setter krav til kvaliteten p√• kabelen er ikke riktig.\n\nDet er ingen situasjoner der Monster-kabler er n√∏dvendig.

The foreign and domestic actors are flooding bots in now so that they can rack up karma/likes/whatever from mostly harmless memes, and then will pivot to misinformation and propaganda once the elections properly kick in. \n\nPersonally I think that needs to be investigated a bit to see if there‚Äôs much truth there, I think the more significant factor is Reddit and other social media‚Äôs have started paying people for getting high karma/engagement on posts. It‚Äôs not much if you‚Äôre a normal user who maybe makes the occasional successful post, but if you control 10,000 bots that can shit out dozens of posts a day then it can be pretty lucrative.

Like the doctor just ‚Äòbolted them on.‚Äô Think Tori Spelling in 2002. Now you don‚Äôt see it as much bc of fat transfers to help contour irregularities.

            "I‚Äôm almost positive she got her implants replaced with smaller ones because I remember reading an article about it‚Äînot gossip or gross speculation. I swear I read about it in the last 10 years. \n\nThat being said I also think that allowing just a shred more body fat has softened the look in addition to a reduction. \n\nIt‚Äôs actually really heartening to see the last 2 photos but maybe she doesn‚Äôt see it that way. She‚Äôs gorgeous and fit but a few of those photos are frankly worrying. The last 2 really seem healthier and I truly hope that she is happy and confident. \n\nI‚Äôm a Taylor fan and she had a similar thing going on for a short while. She‚Äôs always been enviously thin and fit, but she admits that it got dangerous for a bit. We all celebrate healthy fitness.",

She could have done the fashion icon, fashion label thing easily without him and he would probably either coach england or be the face of international football tv if he didn't move to the US mostly for her(at least how it's communicated)¬† On the contrary it always seemed to me that they each took turns in their career which they wouldn't have to do with a no name partner. The whole publicity in their relationship was a phase when they were pretty young and started now up again with the documentary, but there were many silent years as well. And the doc comes at a time when a lot of footballers and musicians got docs. I mean it's pretty possible that you are right as well, I don't know them. I've just watched the England match and remembered watching him play and talked with friends about how weird it always was to connect the great and humble player with the public persona, so this is why I (over)thought this so much¬†",

            "Mind elaborating?",
            "I don‚Äôt know. It seems like Victoria Beckham is the only Spice Girl to have maintained significant star power all these years later and I think her marriage is a key piece of that. I rarely hear about the others but she is often in headlines.",

            "Not to mention that people change, and most marriages have their ups and downs, with times when they love each other fiercely, and times when they can't stand each other. If it's not an actually abusive or otherwise shitty relationship that really should end, the trick seems to be to just hang in there, be decent to each other, and wait for things to change/the wheel to turn to the point where they love and like each other again.

            "We‚Äôre talking about different levels though. George the fifth Beatle Best popularized the celebrity style living, fast cars, champagne bottle service, fashion models every week. \n\nBeckham took that lifestyle, global celebrity, and monetized it. He was maybe not the first to even do that, but he was the biggest to brand himself and now every player does this. \n\nRemember there was a whole ass movie called Bend it like Beckham, not bend it like Best. Also, despite Best‚Äôs stature, he was never perceived as bigger than the club. He was still in the shadow, as a player, of Bobby Charlton and Denis Law. Busby struggled controlling his off field antics but SAF struggled to reign in Beckham‚Äôs overall stardom putting the entire club in his shadow.",
            "The whole point is the ‚Äúbusiness relationship‚Äù. I don‚Äôt want a romantic relationship that‚Äôs guaranteed to fade and in the end basically just becomes a roommate that I‚Äôve tied myself to in order to go through life. I would 100% rather do life alone than end up with a platonic roommate that I‚Äôm stuck with forever.",

Abuse, addiction and adultery certainly are qualifiers for harm but all the rest is largely work throughable, may we all be so fortunate as to find a human in which we can work things through with.",
            "Maybe Geri (Ginger?). Idk about that one!",
            "Fair point, I take that one back. I will still stand on that even if he cheated with legal and consensual people and she forgave him then she will have had her reasons and that there is still a real possibilty that they weren't monogamous at that point or ever",

            "She would have had her reasons for staying with him but you can apply that to any unhappy relationship ever. There‚Äôs plenty of people in unhappy relationships  they all have their reasons for staying in them. Often simply fear of being alone.",

            "To clarify, it's more about such desires being insatiable.  Most people, for example, have a number that they want to hit for retirement, e.g., \"I want to have X dollars available to retire off,\" and when they hit it, they're satiated.  Greed, by its very definition, is never satisfied.  For some people, they get a taste of what it's like to have wealth and power and they are consumed by wanting more, but when they get more, it's never quite as good as the first time, and it's never enough.  It's like an addict that is always chasing that first high.\n\nFor example, if I had 3 million dollars in my retirement account, I'd quit work tomorrow and retire. Instead of trying to make that into 50 million or 500 million, I would spend my time doing the things I love to do, with the knowledge that I don't have to worry about money. However for someone to become a billionaire, they only way that's possible, besides inheritance or winning the lottery, is because the only thing that they want to do is make more money.\n\nIt's the same with power... most well-adjusted people do not want to rule the world and do not want to forcibly change the entire world to fit what they want, partially because it just sounds exhausting, but mostly because they recognize that other people have minds of their own and wills of their own, and that in order to attempt to mold the world to fit one's own view of what it should be like, a lot of innocent people would be hurt in the process, and people with a basic moral compass and the ability to feel empathy find that idea abhorrent.  That's not to say that most people don't want a certain level of freedom to do what they want, but typically people realize that their freedom to swing their fists around stops at their fellow human's face. To become a billionaire, you have to believe that you have the right to swing your fist and hit someone's face (metaphorically) because either you're better or stronger or more deserving than the other person.  You can't truly desire to rule the world unless you believe deep down that there are a lot of people who don't deserve to be treated as people because of some warped view of morality.",

We have bene there, we have done that. Its been 20+ years of capes. Superman could be a hit but the idea that audiences are desperate for a new cinematic universe to fill the void of Marvel is just not true.",
            "Also, after Infinity Wars and Endgame, how does any storyline get people excited? Once you‚Äôve seen a climax that big, it‚Äôs hard to get excited for a standard MCU movie with just a few characters.

            "> Deadpool will be a surefire hit\n\nThink it's less \"will be\" and more \"will likely be\".\n\nLook, I love these movies and want them to right the ship here, but I think that the super hero movie burnout among the casual moviegoer cannot be overestimated. Yes, it's Deadpool and he's a popular character, but this is a movie that assumes awareness of an entirely separate super hero franchise in addition to a D+ show that was built on the back of the very super hero franchise everyone's burnt out on. \n\nEven if this movie is successful, it doesn't guarantee a bright future for the MCU even if subsequent projects are good.",

People aren't \"Marvel\" fatigued, they are \"mediocre ChatGPT script minimum viable product garbage content\" fatigued.",

I want to see more standalone projects made by artists with more creative freedom. The Batman is an example of what I want to see from the MCU and movies like Blade seemed like it was shaping up for that but now that movie is borderline dead in development.",

            "I thought the movie was quite mediocre, both due to Chadwick not being there and the new BP being an absolutely horrible person IRL. When everyone thought she was going to get sacked, she instead got a promotion.\n\nHighly disappointing that the movie was a huge success, because Disney is just going to learn all the wrong lessons from it.",

            "I‚Äôll take the bullet and say what needs to be said. BP was alright, BP2 was overhyped and I would wager the bulk of its box office numbers are due more to loyalty watches than it just being a good movie in general.\n\nWhat do I mean by ‚Äúloyalty watches‚Äù? Well, in my hometown, there were multiple social groups centered around black heritage that made going to see the Black Panther premier a whole event big enough for them to rent out an entire theater just for their group, those same groups did the exact same thing for BP2, understandably. There was the same thing at my college when BP released, probably the same for BP2. I work for a property developer, some of our properties had similar groups that hosted big screening events for BP2. And I could spend an entire thread talking about the various black-centered social groups littered throughout LA that made events out of these movies premiering. \n\nMy point being, a whole lot of the viewers for those movies went to see them more out of social obligation to support their people in Hollywood, than the movie itself being really good. That‚Äôs not to say that it‚Äôs a problem, I actually admire that action; it just explains how such subpar content generated so much buzz and popularity for Marvel. Also, I want to say that I don‚Äôt hate either movie; I personally enjoyed the first more than Wakanda Forever, but I overall liked both movies. I just don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre anywhere near the level the industry often tries to prop them up to.

Not in the top, but Sound of Freedom and the Taylor Swift movie also did very well, and I'd put them in the category of \"event\" movies, too, for better or for worse.\n\nPeople are moving on from theatrical viewings in general and the reason for it is a mix of being able to wait for streaming, tickets being expensive, Covid, etc. Movies therefore need an \"extra\" reason to see them in theatres now to combat those factors that they didn't need before. \n\nBeing a good movie isn't enough since there were other good movies last year that didn't do great.

So there were always going to be some concessions. Another thing we need to be honest about. 2010s Hollywood was not going to spend 150 million on a movie without any white faces. It's dumb, it's bullshit, it's Hollywood being racist but it's true. It wasn't going to happen without some casting changes.\n\nAnyway, there is a slew of things you can blame M. Night for.

So many movies nowadays, especially those with a political message, are always trying to tell the viewer what they should be thinking. \n\nIt's what makes the movie interesting and unique in the film industry. It's also why you'll likely not see a movie like Starship Troopers again anytime soon. To many writers are too obsessed with making sure the audience \"gets it\" and therefore would be reluctant to show the fascists in any positive light. \n\nIt's like how in Black Panther you had that scene where Killmonger randomly chokes out that older woman because he didn't like her opinion.

So instead they started giving big reveals much earlier and trying to keep audiences on their toes.\n\nThat's a long-winded way to say I think part of the issue is Marvel doesn't want to take any risks right now, they want a lot of stories but they won't let any of them go anywhere.  Maybe I'm wrong, but that's how it seems.  No risk taking, individual movies only move the larger universe in small increments, at best you get a hint of something happening in another story just to make you feel like properties are connected.\n\nMost audiences aren't going to watch your TV show if they think it doesn't matter, and they're not going to sit through 20 more movies while you ploddingly find your way.",

Having impossible guidelines, more bureaucracy to navigate (because you absolutely have to increase the amount of people working for you to make it work at that scale), and taxing your entire team with  double or triple the amount of work is not a recipe for success. Maybe good for the corporate numbers in the short term, but you give up a lot of ground long term. If Feige was allowed to scale properly. I think they would be in a good place.

I think this is the first thought everyone had when Kang was introduced.     \nThere's a resolution problem with heroes and villains and their story not ending.  Iron Man's story line is a great example of how to end a story but then you've ended the character.  The multi-universe thing that has always existed in comics which gives new writers an out to bring back dead/popular characters, but adopting this to big budget films is not going to go over so well the way people put up with it in comics.  Comics have been doing this since the 1960's with their silver age hero characters, but we haven't had to resolve this problem yet in billion dollar films.

            "Marvel needs DC‚Äôs villains and DC needs Marvel‚Äôs movie quality.",
            "I feel like a lot of this could be solved with more prestige series. Take Spider-Man or Batman for instance. Both characters with big rogues galleries that they fight all the time, but how can you capture that in a movie series? Either you crowd the films with side plots with other villains, and run the risk of pulling a *Spider-Man 3*. Or you have a villain a movie a year and your star has aged 10 years by the time you've introduced half the villains, the actor that played the elderly villain died a while back, and three more have scheduling conflicts, so now you can't do the big villain team up/mass prison escape/etc. Or how could you possibly have a solo Batman for a while, then have Dick Grayson grow up as Robin to become Night Wing, then have Jason Todd have a go of it before he gets the crowbar, then a grieving Batman, before Tim Drake, etc. With films you just don't have the right ratios between in-universe time, actual screentime, and production time\n\nHow would you do that?\n\nMaybe the universe progresses at the actual rate of production. It's plausible that all that happens in a decade or so. But then you've only got like 9 or 10 films, which feels really empty because the events of a given movie generally don't span a very long time in-universe unless you have clunky time skips breaking up the flow. You've either got only a handful of sparse events leaving you to wonder \"wait, what the fuck has batman been up to the rest of the year?\" between instances of big Batman action, or you skip a lot of the big Batman action. Either way a binge watch of it will probably feel like \"wait, why did split off so soon?\"\n\nOr you can do a TV series where you can pass the universe-time at the same rate as production time, but tell more story with more screen time. S1 of *Loki* had 280 minutes of screen time to develop its characters and tell a story. That's at least 2 movies to reach the same screen time, which means at least 2 years IRL, and the pacing will feel all kinds of whack. There's like 50% more screen time in *Agents of SHIELD* alone than there is from *Iron Man* to *Endgame*. Give us prestige series with movies for the really big events. Introduce Batman in a movie, followed by then a 6-13 episode season of prestige series with a villain of the week/fortnight, Bruce adopts Dick Grayson in the sequel film, he gets a season or two, becomes Nightwing in the next movie, etc. It just makes so much more sense as a format for such a massive universe",
            "Black widow also hurt by coming out AFTER we know her fate. \n\nIf it had come out between infinity war and endgame I think it would have been great. It was neat learning about her past but it was also kinda like \"why should I care I know what happens.\"",
            "She-Hulk was presented as being a workplace sitcom, which is a form of television that inherently spends a long time maintaining the status quo without much forward progression. And that's perfectly fine, as long as you make the comedy *funny*!\n\nThe issue was that this was a sitcom that seemed to ignore the lessons that were perfected decades ago about how to structure a good self-contained sitcom episode. Worse, it was a workplace sitcom in which none of the main character's work colleagues were distinctive or funny. It had funny side-characters (Madisynn; the new, pacifist version of Abomination), but they weren't part of the recurring cast.\n\nIt's telling that everyone's favourite episodes were the one where Wong turned up, the one where Daredevil turned up, and the final episode that finally went for broke with the metafictional stuff.",
            "> It was weird to come out of that movie and be like, \"That movie kinda sucked, but I really miss Chadwick Boseman.\"\n\nEvery day fam. Especially since I actually enjoyed the twist they had on Namor, and would loved to have seen them actually duel it out rather than all the other stuff they added to compensate (Ironheart, weird mermaid costume from Wakanda, etc).",
            "This is a major factor that I don't see taken into consideration enough. \n\nIt wasn't the best movie but imagine how much better it could have been if they could have had the three leads doing the usual circuit of YouTube interviews and late night shows. \n\nIman Vellani's enthusiasm alone would have sold some more tickets.",
            "All fair points, though I really liked both WandaVision and Ms Marvel (and the Captain Marvel movie). Secret Invasion‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ exists. For some reason. \n\nI think Marvel bungled the timing. If they released The Marvels much earlier, it could have ridden on the hype from their Disney+ shows, now it arrived so late that even people who liked those were like ‚Äùwait, who are these characters again?‚Äù (Also a common problem from all their other shows and movies lately. ‚ÄùHey, remember this cool character we introduced three years ago and are now randomly bringing back?‚Äù ‚ÄùUh, no?‚Äù)",

            "That's what killed the 24 episode season. People no longer were willing to accept filler (good, most filler sucks), but the writers couldn't keep up with that.\n\nSo a lower episode count per season came in to compensate.",
            "As compared to the bloated whale-corpse of a budget it had, there's not enough Vellani enthusiasm to sell enough tickets.",
            "But its not just that, its that the *hype from a streaming show* is substantially smaller than people outside of the fandom appreciate. \n\nThe thing that Disney is slowly learning is that their overgeneration of content has led to a place where nobody gives a shit anymore. \n\nIn phases 1-3 you had a small, handful of characters to care about, and only 5 Avengers. Now... the list is so large that nobody knows and only a few diehards actually care about. Shit on Disney+ is not bringing people to the theaters. Its an altogether worse decision to try and make those characters a centerpiece of their film universe.",

He eventually started some sort of electronic part wholesaler which meant that they were well off but she wasn‚Äôt that way her whole life. When he came into money he bought an old second hand RR and he used to drop her off to school in it. Bc she lived and went to school in a working class area, getting dropped off in an RR led to her being bullied and excluded  for others thinking that she thought she was better than everyone else. She used to beg her dad to drop her to school in the work van. This is the lore of ‚ÄúPOSH‚Äù spice because everyone used to call her posh. But in the UK class is much more than income.

            "I'm gonna try to do a \"\"\"quick\"\"\" rundown but I will leave a tl dr here at the start because I'm probably going to end up dumping a wall of text.\n\nTldr: Liberal president is elected by a small margin, people had too many expectation from such government.\n\nSome context: primaries in Argentina are not done by the parties themselves, instead we do a \"mock\" election where parties can fill more than one candidate for one position and the one that gets the most votes is the one that actually becomes the candidate in the \"real\" election.\n\nMacri is the founder of PRO, a liberal-conservative party, think of the Republican Party before they went insane. In 2015 they made an alliance with the historic UCR party which depending on which faction is in control is either a social-liberal/soc dem party, and CC ARI which is a christian-democracy party.\n\nIn the election Macri wins the primaries with 24% of the votes (his coalition gathering a total of 30%). That 24% (where I'm included) represents the \"OG\" Macri vote, aka, the people that chose Macri and his economic liberalism as their first choice. In the real election he comes in second and manages to keep the votes of his coalition allies and gains an extra 4% (mainly from older people that usually don't bother to vote in the primaries).\n\nThe other 2 candidates, Scioli which represented the kirchnerists came in first with 37% of the vote, and Massa, an ex kirchnerist representing peronists that don't like the kirchners got 21%. Since no candidate met the criteria to win in the 1st round it means that we went to a 2nd round, with both peronists candidates having the clear majority of the votes (58%).\n\nIn the 2nd round Macri wins against Scioli by 3 points, a bigger part of Massa's electorate broke in favor of Macri.\n\nSo after 12 years of kirchnerism, we have a new party in power, so kirchnerists are gone, right? Well, out of the 24 provinces, Macri's alliance only controlled 4, in the House they were the first plurality 86/257 members, but mainly thanks to the peronists having splintered into 2 groups, peronists still made a majority of the house.  In the senate it was even worse, they only had 17 out of 72, with the kirchnerists having a majority of 39. And this is only speaking of institutional power, the peronists control groups of people that protests and break shit if the government doesn't give them money, on top of also controlling most if not all of the unions that casually start demanding more than usual when the peronists are not in power.\n\nSo you have a weak government that is tasked with controlling inflation, get out of default, cut down public spending, restarting an economy that hasn't really grown in the last 5 years, and all of that without pissing off around 40% of the people that made you president.\n\nIn the first 2 years his government was slow, with the most notorious thing being that we came out of default and we started adjusting the price of things like public transportation, electricity and gas that were all heavily subsidized, but all of this was done without lowering spending too much because the government was too weak and taking loans to cover the deficit.\n\nAfter the mid term elections they managed to become the first plurality in both chambers of congress (if you don't combine the peronists blocks). The first important legislation he passed was a new formula on how to calculate pensions. Until then pensions were calculated with 30% inflation +70% revenue, Argentina at this point has a chronic inflation problem and old people suffer this the most because the formula doesn't take inflation that much into account, so they inverted the numbers, 70% will come from inflation, 30% from revenue.\n\nLeftists groups (the kirchnerists and the marxists parties) took this as a brutal advance against pensioners, and attacked congress with rocks while they were discussing the law. This reminded everyone that even if the kirchnerists didn't represent a majority of the people anymore they were violent enough to matter.\n\nRemember how the deficit was not being lowered that much and we were covering it with debt? Well, at the start of 2018 we had a hike on interests rates so financing this slow adjustment of public spending stopped being viable, so we went and made a deal with the evil and spooky IMF. The IMF gave us cheap loans in exchange of actually having to adjust spending at a decent speed.\n\nWhile all of this was happening the way our central bank was somewhat keeping inflation under control kept getting more and more expensive because starting from Dec 16, 2015 the US Federal Reserve started raising their interests rate. For some context the Fed's interests rate was completely frozen from 2008 until 2015, so it was super unprecedented. \n\nThe basic idea is: the central bank would issue a series of short term bonds that were meant to encourage people to stay in ARS instead of changing them to USD, but with the Fed raising interests rates it kept getting more and more difficulted. [Like holy hell, look at this, I'm not saying there was a conspiracy or something but Macri just got really unlucky.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds_rate#Rates_since_2008_global_economic_downturn)\n\nFor the rest of his government it was a grind of trying to stay on program with the IMF while preventing the streets from erupting in flames. In 2019 it's time for elections, the program the government did these last 2 years was working pretty good, we were almost at 0 deficit for that year, and inflation while still bad in the yearly rate came under control in the monthly rates. BUT, this was done by lowering subsidies on electricity and gas, which people LOVED. So effects of the responsible macro policy were not being felt by the population yet, and Macri was even facing internal opposition for these policies from the soc dem part of his alliance.\n\n[I know things look scary right now but, it's gonna get way worse.] (https://www.youtube.com/shorts/BVueEr6GnHI) Remember how peronists were still the majority but they were splitted into 2 groups that hated each other? Well, they reconciled and made a united peronist front and the rest is history.",
            "But somehow a person calling a sport by a different name blows your mind?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also speak spanish. Maybe learning another language is a good way to learn that being a nazi about dialect is one of the most smooth brain things you can do.\n\nDid you know that in Spain there are places where it's called futbol and places where it's called balompie? Different names for something within the same language? Crazy, I know",
            "Thank you so much for all these details and write up. I had a rough grasp on some of it, my biggest thing was Macri trying to connect with the US again as well.  I wonder if some of the maga theater shit is also whats affecting us there. From the little I see it just feels like poison all around the Argentinean political sphere and it‚Äôs wild how deep we are diving in the Venezuela hole and how our culture has that grandeur about it still. \n\nArgentinidad al palo.",
            "Damn, some random guy on the internet just told me to learn other languages, whatever will I do now?\n\nI know different people speak different languages, thanks. Here's what the difference is. By the time football was invented, all languages around the world were already more or less well established (since it was around the second half of the 19th century). So they basically learned about the concept of football and then decided to name it something different for no reason whatsoever.\n\nImagine we had our fully formed modern version of English, but then we discovered sushi for the first time. Then we took the concept of sushi and came up with a completely new word for it for no reason. That's basically what soccer is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: for the record I lived in Spain for 4 years, and nobody calls it fucking balonpie in Spanish or Catalan or Basque. Nice try though Mr. Worldwide :)"

            "No you don't sound preachy to me. It's nice to be reminded of that. I think we must be around the same age and if that's the case then I know you remember the diet culture we grew up in. I remember hearing Hillary Duff was fat as a tween and thinking that I was too. I remember how every commercial was lite or zero carb diet foods that had all nutritional value taken out of them. It was awful. I got an eating disorder at age 11 and got treatment at age 20 in 2013. Thank God I did. My life without bulimia is so much better. But I remember how we couldn't watch TV while I was in treatment because of the commercials. So they normally screened movies and then let us watch those. Well someone didn't screen the movie we got once and it was a disaster, funny in retrospect. They got Pitch Perfect and to our surprise a full on projectile vomiting scene came on. It upset a lot of us who had been being heavily sheltered from images like that for the months long stays. It's wild how it's everywhere. I see this generation hyperfixating on skincare and that's great but it does lead some to think perfect skin is just about routine. Like being overweight having acne can be totally out of our control. Yes it's good to be conscious of what we use on our bodies and what we out into it but we can forget about the many genetic factors and illnesses that can result in acne or being overweight. I don't have kids so I hope parents and teachers are remembering to keep that in mind.",
            "Tell me why my brothers are older but their girlfriends act the same‚Ä¶\n\nAnyway makes total sense, I read it as if your brothers beat your husband up you‚Äôd drop a dime on them üò≠",
            "Very astute of you, we're same gen for sure.. I remember allll of that. The magazines, how they treated Hillary Duff, how they treated Britney Spears when she performed Gimme More at the VMAs. I'm so sorry to hear about your suffering, especially since back then most people's response to eating disorders was \"JuSt EaT a SaNdWhIcH!!1!\" But you had to be so strong to overcome that, and I wish those same people understood what that takes. The fact diet culture's messaging was so strong they actually screened all media during treatment is mind blowing... I always thought I was fat from that messaging too, at 5'5\"-6\" and 135 lbs... (and the fact that my high school boyfriend bought into it wholesale and regurgitated it back to me didn't help), but my ED didn't surface until right after high school. My mom got me a trainer at LA Fitness thinking it'd help me feel better, but instead it turned into me purging by over-exercising and restricting my calories to only \"1200\" a day (though I always over-estimated so it was likely even less), I refused to ever sit, I'd park in the back of a parking lot and RUN to the store when I went shopping, I ate the same strictly regimented things at the same time every day until you could literally see every bone in my body, even my sternum without breathing in, and my period completely went away. It was at this point I started running into this creepy guy in a local bookstore (I'd go and read baking recipes which I'd then make for others and eat none of myself), and one of the times he approached me he complimented my body and asked how I stay in \"such great shape.\" Even then I was appalled. But I didn't get better until the nutritionist I was VERY lucky to have, told me that if I didn't stop what I was doing, my heart was either going to stop, or explode. And recovery was still a long, painful road.\n\nIt's a great insight that skincare is the new gen's version of weight loss for us, and while I don't have kids either, I find it kind of bittersweet... I'm glad that the new fixation is less of an immediate health risk, but also sad that it's just a different iteration of the same thing all over again - an obsession with the only two things we're told by mass media make us \"worthy\", youth and beauty. This is even highlighted by the \"clean girl\" trend, it's right out in the open that you're expected to look \"naturally beautiful\" and showing that it's still a trick but even then it's still the unobtainable dream that girls actively pursue... I suspect it's the same struggle our parents had, because no matter how many times you're told that media is an illusion, the messaging burrows deeper than that. It sucks, to say the least. But we came out of it, with scars but we did it... so these girls will be okay too, and they're at least more media savvy than we were, so hopefully the cuts aren't as deep and the trend keeps going until we're just clear of shit like this altogether.\n\nIf you happen to still be here after that novel, though... I'm glad you made it through and that you made it out on top. 11-20 is a long time, and I know that battle wasn't easy. I can't imagine what it really took. But I know it means you're awesome, and I'm happy you're here.",
            "What a beautiful thing for you to be vulnerable and share your story to help another stranger feel seen. Thank you for giving me that gift. Your words of encouragement are powerful and really made me look back at myself with pride for my strength. Thank you for pointing it out so I could see that too. \n\nYou put yourself through torture to try to make yourself what society wanted. I am sorry that you had to endure that and society's horrible attitude towards our struggle. Your journey sounds really painful but impactful. I am glad that you made it out to see the otherside. I hope that's not a demons you're still actively trying to outrun. I know how hard it is to fully shake that off. You've got a friend in me if you ever need someone else to listen or give advice where I can. You must so possess that strength you're complimenting me on for overcoming it yourself! Hope you are proud too\n\nThe hoops we make women jump through to feel like they're beautiful is dumbfounding. I felt sad for the girls in this generation because I'm sure the body dysmoprhianis extremely strong with the use of filters being so prevelant. I know I got burnt out of my beauty routine because it felt like a chore. The getting up hours before work to do my hair and makeup as if I was working in media was ridiculous. The fun of makeup artistry and self care is taken out when it's just a prerequisite to be apart of society. The questions i would get from work when i didnt do my routine were absurd. My male boss even sent me home a couple of times, from a job where I chased around 5-9 olds all day in summer art school, because I looked like I was sick and going to pass out. Bitch please.  Rupauls right when she said we're all born naked and the rest is drag."

            "We really have to ruin everything. The show was good, 98% factual, 2% entertainment.",
            "So the media who tried to ruin his life are now fact-checking a story from his perspective, which he's never had the chance to get out to the public... and only find two very minor points....",

            "I haven't watched the documentary, but this bit would be wrong:\n\n>In the doc, after Beckham is given a red card and sent off the pitch for fouling an Argentine player, the story goes that he suffered hostility even from his own Man Utd supporters until he redeemed himself at the end of the following season. In fact, the Sunday Times reports, Beckham stayed in favour at his home ground from the moment he set foot back there.\n\nUnited fans rallied around Beckham in the face of the fans of other clubs singling him out. It was a point of pride for fans to be supportive of players who were under media siege - Cantona after his ban in 1995, Beckham in 1998/99 and Phil Neville after he conceded the penalty that knocked England out of Euro 2000.\n\nThere were surely a few who were upset with him, but the vast majority were determined to support him.",

            "If you make a documentary about yourselves then surely you‚Äôll paint a favourable and one sided picture.",
            "This is a ridiculous argument. You're either a fan or not and if you don't intimately  understand European football  culture it's not really relevant to you. I'm wasn't the biggest fan but felt the doc was beautiful shot and laid things out as even as I'd expect.",
            "This is the worst article I‚Äôve ever read. Just like a superstar can executive produce a documentary about themselves, a troll ass media outlet can write shitty articles and get them published.",

            "I read through the list twice to make sure I understood ‚Ä¶ how minor they were. I know very little about football and even less about David Beckham, but I thoroughly enjoyed the documentary. Even as I watched it, I knew it was likely just a PR vehicle for him, but seeing that these flimsy inaccuracies are the best that a tabloid could come up with, well, it‚Äôs way more factual than I ever thought it was. I‚Äôm giving it two thumbs up now.",
            "Just how this article is barely considered journalism.",

Well, Victoria was pissed off!‚Äù *gesticulates* \n\nThat candid comment by Victoria in the third person threw me off and I started laughing because I had expected a sanitised PR answer. \n\nI turned to my spouse and said, ‚ÄúEven being David Beckham gets the same reaction when he does something without asking his wife. Wives all want the same thing, even when you‚Äôre Victoria Beckham.‚Äù\n\nThat single moment made me adore Victoria Beckham for being honest about how life was.",
            "Are they misunderstanding the doc? I thought they clearly showed his club supported him but England as a whole, from the moment he got off the plane, did not.",
            "You should definitely watch the doc, it‚Äôs pretty accurate about this, and how his United family held him together throughout this period. He comes across incredibly well, with his flaws not evaded.\n\nEdit:spelling",

            "Yup.  Hated Man United, so always loathed Beckham.\n\nGot a lot more time for him after watching the doc, than before.\n\nKinda crazy what you forget, right? Also found it funny they didn't touch on him skyrocketing that crucial penalty against Portugal in the Euros. People would be like, \"Oh he Beckham'd it!\", when they missed a penalty over the top for years!",
            "Didn‚Äôt read.",

            "I agree. It‚Äôs a fantastic documentary and as a football fan I don‚Äôt give two hoots about some inacurracies in his personal life. If this is all they got then Beckamp is definitely worth cherishing as a sports icon that entertained millions many times over.",

            "So agree! Also her face when David told her he wanted to leave LA. I laughed but felt for her.",
            "Me too. I didn‚Äôt know anything about her except that she was Posh Spice, but, to me, she had always seemed sort of haughty and cold. Her personality did not seem to come out in photos. After watching this doc, I honestly thought she was great. It was totally endearing how they met and how they tried to see each other and be together as much as possible. And she was so frank and genuine about their relationship. It made me want to hang out with her and have a beer.",
            "Seriously, I thought this was pretty clear, as well. They seem confused.",
            "I remember the doc same as you. He felt safe and supported as soon as he was back with Man U fans on home ground I thought",
            "I'm not sure there is any world where Beckham is one of the greatest foolballers of all time! Greatest marketed maybe, but not as a footballing talent!",
            "Yeah I think they left out a lot which was really weird. Glad they showed all the abuse he got. Really shows how people lose their minds over sport. \n\nAnd the fling in Spain. The doc didn‚Äôt say whether it was true or not.",
            "What did I miss? It‚Äôs yet another example of Netflix putting out nonsense.",
            "I was reacting to the title.  Try context next time",
            "Hahaha! I‚Äôm laughing just recalling it.   \n\nShe became instantly relatable. \n\nAll wives wave their hands around when cornered with extreme exasperation, even when you‚Äôre Mrs David Beckham.",
            "It‚Äôs British reporting. I always think of when Harry Potter called out Rita skeeter (the reporter) in the goblet of fire. ‚Äúmy eyes are not glistening with the ghosts of my past‚Äù‚Ä¶",
            "The guy could score a goal with a single corner kick. Consistently. It‚Äôs no different from Jordan air dunking. It‚Äôs a unique talent that everyone tries to copy but they have their own angles and physical traits that ensure copies are not as good as the real deal.",
            "How many footballers have you seen score a goal from their own half deliberately and perfectly?",
            "You still need the skills to be marketable.",
            "I don't remember him actually ever denying that it happened.",
            "That‚Äôs what I mean. They neither denied nor confirmed it. I wish they had a bit more info on that.",
            "They way Victoria spoke about it made me think there really was an affair.",

There is no doubt they have made huge marks in the worlds of fashion, sports, music and philanthropy in the UK, the Commonwealth, the United States, and beyond!. Being seen with them is a *thing*.\n\nI have a theory that when David Beckham knew he wanted to do a docu-series type of show, he did it at Netflix on purpose, he knew he and his wife could churn out a show that would far surpass anything Harry had done in awards and viewership. I think the Netflix show the Beckhams did, which was undeniably a HUGE success in every way, (they even got a Super bowl ad out of it!!!!) was Beckhams eff you to Harry. This is David Beckham after all, super competitive, and he likes to 'win' and he is a staunch monarchist. \n\nAs for Harry and Meghan, this story really goes against Meghan's thirsty-at-all-costs image.

            "No, this story was making the rounds a while back, and the Beckhams did appear to speak, confirming the feud, via their sources.",

With the U.S. hosting the World Cup you‚Äôd think she‚Äôd play it smart and get archwell to sponsor but as always she never looks too far ahead. Every important billionaire and eligible athlete will be at the games. So will Kim kardashian looking for husband 4 if she doesn‚Äôt go down with diddy. Roach will not get an invite. Meanwhile William will probably go to Canada with the kids to cheer on England.¬†",

            "That‚Äôs certainly true now about the pecking order, but back in 2018, Harry and Meghan‚Äôs stars were as high as they would ever go. They were the hot new working royals. An invitation to their wedding was a big deal.¬†\n\nIt‚Äôs so mind boggling how far below they are now.¬†",
            "Probably why she didn‚Äôt invite them to the wedding dinner.  She‚Äôs hyper competitive with Catherine, and the idea of the Beckhams hanging with the Prince & Princess of Wales (then Duke & Duchess of Cambridge) made her gag with envy.",
            "David was apparently one of the few people Harry would've listened to (like William, Catherine, and \"Skippy\" Inskip) so she had to sever those relationships quickly to guarantee the ring on her finger.",
            "Meghan because a member of the RF, and lost all sense and didn‚Äôt  know how to act. She also clearly doesn‚Äôt know how to play the long game. That‚Äôs why she bungled the Beckham connection and the connection to the RF. The moment she thinks she has power over you or a situation she goes scorched earth.\n\nShe likely thought the Beckhams were below her, and would always be looking to use her and her new connections. Unlike her and Harry, the Beckhams can stand on their own in Hollywood, the UK, Fashion and sporting world.",
            "And I am sure Meg was incandescent with rage after Beckham won an Emmy that she wasn't even nominated for.",
            "For all of Meghan‚Äôs thinking that she belongs with the big players, this behaviour shows she is not. Big stars always align with big stars. They know how the gig works. That is why agencies like WME have famous names appearing together at functions. Stronger together, even if you don‚Äôt like each other.",
            "Yes, he reported on this when he did the book on Meghan. David flew half way around the globe as a favor to harry, and then they refused to meet him. M also offended them when she claimed (with no evidence as per) that Posh had leaked a story about them.\n\n\nTakes aways from the credibility of their claim that William leaked about them. I hate that they make themselves authorities on everything when they are so full of shit. Like, even if they aren't actually trying to lie sometimes they still have no reasoning skills or sense.",

            "Meghan must have been seething with envy and hatred, determined to soar above them and instead landed with a thump far below. The ones she chases - Ellen, Oprah, TP - are going through rough patches now. The Beckhams have had some controversies of their own, but always get through. \n\nI remember Meghan endlessly going on in interviews about Ellen telling her to get a shelter dog (Bogart, who she Markled because he didn't like Harry) and Ellen making public her wish for a wedding invitation, which she didn't get. So she got Meghan back with all those \"jokes\" on her show.",

Beckham played a key role in promoting Qatar's World Cup hosting, and now he's advocating for their acquisition of Manchester United, a club he once served with distinction.\n\nThe implications of such a takeover are far-reaching and demand scrutiny. Qatar's government has been linked to extremist groups, including providing safe harbor to leaders of Hamas. This isn't just a business deal; it's a political maneuver with considerable geopolitical implications. The prospect of a club as iconic as Manchester United being acquired by a government with such a problematic record should give pause to anyone concerned with ethical governance.\n\nMoreover, it's essential to note that any Western individual who accepts payment from Qatar or Saudi Arabia for their so-called \"sportswashing\" projects is complicit in funding terror. Such involvement essentially means having blood on one's hands, given the regimes' ties to extremist groups.",

I looked into it and found The New Yorker article she wrote about her ordeal, and it helped me so much with the post-stroke anxiety that doctors never warned me about. After reading this entry, the panic attacks still sucked, but I somehow was able to manage them slightly better every time. It‚Äôs been over 3 years, and while I still suffer from minor anxiety attacks, I can‚Äôt remember the last time I had a true panic, especially from a headache. \n\n‚ÄúA few weeks after that second surgery, I went with a few other cast members to Comic-Con, in San Diego. The fans at Comic-Con are hardcore; you don‚Äôt want to disappoint them. There were several thousand people in the audience, and, right before we went on to answer questions, I was hit by a horrific headache. Back came that sickeningly familiar sense of fear. I thought, This is it. My time is up; I‚Äôve cheated death twice and now he‚Äôs coming to claim me. As I stepped offstage, my publicist looked at me and asked what was wrong. I told her, but she said that a reporter from MTV was waiting for an interview. I figured, if I‚Äôm going to go, it might as well be on live television. But I survived. I survived MTV and so much more. In the years since my second surgery I have healed beyond my most unreasonable hopes. I am now at a hundred per cent.‚Äù",

I also think he had the skill, just look at the clubs he started for and the competitions they won. \n\nBut most of all, I think you are just considering the player that he was and not the player he would have been trained to become if he was a teenager in the 2010s instead of the 1990s. A kid with his skill set and physical attributes would certainly be a midfielder and not a winger.",
            "Right midfielders are wingers",
            "He was a much more intelligent player than Trent is now. Coupled with a much higher work rate, he‚Äôd do a much better job in the middle and was often used there including the 99 CL final.\n\nHe‚Äôd be a perfect pass-and-move midfielder who would be immense in a high pressing side as he could run all day.",
            "Scholes actually started as a striker and dropped backwards. He only really became a central mid around 97ish.",

            "Nice straw man",
            "No, they're not. In the same way as a striker is a particular type of centre forward, a winger is a particular type of wide midfielder. It means someone that takes on his man and runs into space.",
            "Calling him more intelligent than Trent is frankly bizarre.  Trent is one of the most intelligent players around.\n\nWe know exactly what sort of player Beckham was because we can watch his whole career.  He had a lot of stamina and would be good in a press, but a lot of his running was fairly aimless ball chasing.  \n\nHe was not great in open play during the 99 final.  Did you forget that United were toothless and losing until those set pieces in the very final seconds?\n\nBeckham was a good player with a great passing range but the revisionism around him is incredible.  Nobody at the time would have said Beckham was a better or more important player for United than Scholes, Keane or Giggs.\n\nHe played in central midfield for England against Northern Ireland in 2005.  England lost.",
            "Plenty worse players than Beckham play a Pirlo type role.",
            "He did it all the time? Remember that season Van Nistlerooy scored about 45 goals? Half of those were Beckham dropping the ball at his feet from crosses.",
            "You must think Beckham is Ward Prowse \n\nBeckham was world class in general play.  The set pieces were a bonus",
            "Prime Becks was every bit as good as KDB was at his best.\n\nModern attacking systems would suit him more if anything because of the way they're structured, he'd have a set role rather than the more freelance style of the older systems.\n\nFerguson often had him coming into the half space anyway with Neville overlapping because they weren't getting support on the left for Giggs with Irwin preferring to sit back.\n\nSo if anything he was the pre-cursor to the De Bruyne role and paved the way for it. \n\nCalling him just a set piece specialist is way off, he was so much more than that and was legitimately world class at his peak.",
            "All 115? How the hell could you afford that and are you hiring?",
            "The hell you did lol. \nNo need to lie",
            "presumably you saw the performance vs Greece then? One of the top 10 performances in a single game of all time by any player.",
            "How is that a straw man? You said he had poor ability - based on your (shit) opinion. I have demonstrated 4 excellent clubs with world class managers all consistently picked him over a 19 year career. Directly contradicting your statement that he was a limited player",
            "> Calling him more intelligent than Trent is frankly bizarre. Trent is one of the most intelligent players around.\n\nHe really isn't, and that's coming from a Liverpool fan. He has exceptional long passing technique (for me he's the best in the world by a good way) but his positional intelligence in the middle of the park is, right now, extremely subpar.",
            "Yes I agree. I also don‚Äôt think Beckham was particularly good at it either. Good on the right though. There is a stack of revisionist takes on Beckham. He was never a playmaker or someone controlled a game.",
            "No, it was RVNs ability to get on the end of anything that was speculatively knocked into the box.\n\nWhy the fuck every side in the premiership thought that leaving Beckham the time and space to stop the ball have a think and a wee run up is the real question here.\n\nGenuinely wonder how Ferguson managed that.",
            "Absolutely not. Decent player with a world class dead ball",
            "Beckham had the technique of KDB but no where near the vision so no he wasn't every bit as good as KDB at that role. \n\nBeyond hitting it accurately which Beckham was great at it's also the vision to see the pass. Becks had ok vision but that wasn't his speciality.",
            "This is an unbelievable take! Becks was a right midfielder with an incredible right foot, one of the best passers in the game if not the best. But crossing and mid - short range passing is very different. Entirely different roles and passing ranges. KDB has shorter incisive vision, Becks was never that player. The closest player to Becks currently is Trent, and you see how tricky it is to get Trent a role in a team. That‚Äôs Becks.",
            "I didn't go to the Lichtenstein away game because the ticket allocation was tiny. Also missed the Turkey away game in the same campaign as England refused their ticket allocation \n\nThere are many fans who go to every/nearly every game. I barely missed a game between 1996 and the Russia World Cup in 2018. Since then I've  really cut back and I've only been once since the Euro 21 final.\n\nIt's not very expensive if you book far ahead and use nearly all of your holiday following the team.",

            "Ran around like a maniac for most of the game trying to be a hero while ignoring team mates and then scored a great free kick to rescue a draw at home to a poor team , yes I was there. Fortunately Germany failed to beat the Fins in the other game which saved our blushes and largely made the game irrelevant",
            "No , I said he lacked the ability of KdB, one of the best midfielders of the modern era",
            "That's not intelligence though, that's just training.  You can't be a good long passer without good game intelligence because long passing is literally all about looking at the game state and seeing in your mind what it's going to be in a few seconds.",
            "I think though that was a function of the time he played in. The role he played doesn't really exist anymore so he wouldn't be used there. He was so good on the right whipping in crosses there was no point in him playing centrally. Had that been his position though I believe he could have controlled games from a deep midfield area. He didn't lack any attributes for that.",
            "Yup, one trick pony made to look good by van nistelroy.",
            "Im not taking anything away from RVN. His finishing that season was probably the best I've ever seen. But we struggled after Beckham left and i remember Ruud talking about how good his crosses were and how much we missed him.",
            "Well, if you discount the crappy near post corners that he always played and always got cut off.",

            "I had no interest in Russia, Qatar and probably Saudi.\n\nI've started taking my kid to club games in Europe instead.",
            "At the end of his career after over a decade of playing on the right.... \n\nWhat attributes did Beckham lack for playing that role?",
            "What did he win with England?\n\nAnd he had Ronaldo, figo, Zidane, Raul and makelele at Madrid.  I thought it was accepted at the time that Madrid only bought him for shirt sales?",
            "What a strange question. I‚Äôm basing my opinion from seeing him play not Football Manager stats ffs. Plenty of players ‚Äòshould‚Äô have been good at things but weren‚Äôt",
            "England lost 0-1 to Northern Ireland in 2005 with Beckham famously playing the deep Pirlo role.  He pinged the ball around and didn't achieve much.  Beckham was 30, in his prime."

Until a few minutes ago I had no idea what clotted cream was so  looked it up. Reading the recipe made me think \"that's not difficult\", until I got to the part that said it had to be cooked for ten to twelve hours! I may have to take a trip to GB, would be less work than cooking anything for that length of time. I now envy anyone who can just buy clotted cream.",

Giggs and Kanchelskis would switch sides too but you had this symmetry of fast wingers whatever side they took.\n\nKanchelskis is replaced by Beckham and there was a real asymmetry that worked out.

UEFA and Barcelona are both corrupt. He was robbed of Ballon Dor in 99. He literally scored against Barcelona himself in the UCL group stage to equalize for United and won the treble only for the corrupt org and club to give the award to Rivaldo. clownshow.\n\nMy favourite player of all time. Dont take any of this from me, take it from his teammates like Cantona, Keane, Zidane, R. Carlos, Ronaldo Nazario, Figo, Rio, his England teammates whom he carried in every qualifier and tournament who let him down.\n\nGo ask Cole, RVN, Ronaldo Nazario, Zidane or anyone who played with him or even against him who d they want on their imaginary world XI and he s on all of them, first name on the sheet for the strikers, no doubt in my mind.\n\nWe will never see anything like him ever again.\n\nGentleman, Icon, Genius, Leader, Team player.",

            "After Cantona, he is my favourite player of all time. People underrate him because they only remember his fame. Or they only remember his crosses and free kicks. \n\nWhat I loved about Beckham was that he wasn‚Äôt the fastest, particularly good at dribbling or a good tackler but he made the most of his talent, gave everything for his team, had insane tenacity and an insane level of hardworking. IMO only Figo has been a better right sided midfielder.",
            "I don‚Äôt know how this is even up for question. Not only was he possibly the greatest crosser of a ball in English football history, his work rate was second to none. What a footballer.",

            "Better and not appreciated half enough. Everyone knows his free kick taking ability but his work rate and engine were unreal. People forget he played the 99 Champions League final in centre mid with Giggs and Jesper Blomqvist on the wings, so he was out of position and was brilliant and did not stop running.",
            "Thing is, while Beckham was brilliant, he was never getting ahead of Keane/Scholes in centre mid. Giggs, Keane, Scholes, Becks. My God still can't believe that midfield.\n\nEdit Spelling",

            ">>Beckham average distance covered in a premier league game was 14.1km\n\nI know we‚Äôd want players who run more just like the old days. But as what the studies he mentioned, the intensity of premier league has increased a lot over the years.\n\nOf course the player‚Äôs athleticism improved but i dont think it ever caught up to the intensity of the game. And that doesnt even cover how much the volume of games have increased since then.\n\nThe combination of game volume + distance covered + intensity would just resulted in a possibility of career ending injury. So the players now ran lesser distance to avoid risks of injury which i honestly believe was also instructed by the coach/medical team as well.\n\nI dont believe in this modern game that beckham would run that much. But i‚Äôd love to see some of his brilliant passes and crosses in this modern era and see how our strikers would handle it.",
            "Yes and no. By the layperson, he was better than Messi. By people who actually watched him he was a very very very good footballer who had wonderful free kicks, crosses and work effort.",

            "Yes, easily top 3 midfielders of all time imo",
            "For all his lack of pace and tricks he more than made up for with his heart and determination. Beckham was one of many players of that famed United era that would literally run through walls to win a game, and perform for the club. \n\n\nHe always scored massive goals at important times, or created them. \n\nHe gets a lot of detractors because of his celebrity, but he was fantastic player, one that Ronaldo took several seasons to step up and fill his boots.",
            "his chance creating crosses were just too good.. ronaldo the phenomenon once said, I just ran into spaces and the ball will always be there...\n\nwatching the documentary, seeing the spaces defenders gave last time. \n\nI quite curious whether beckham will still be able to make those crosses with the suffocating pressing nowadays",
            "Can you imagine if our current players ran as much as becks",
            "He was better and underrated and I don‚Äôt understand why he was abused for World Cup exit \nIf everyone could have buried their penalties we would have gone through anyway \n\n\nNever wanted to leave United \n\nbut was forced out due to fame, and United could have made soo much money with his brand, \n\ninstead Real Madrid made lots of money",
            "There is a timeline where Beckham did not get that red card and did not go on a revenge tour to help to get the treble.",
            "An underrated centre midfield player.\nSuperb mentality as someone mentioned. Pure captain material.",
            "Best actual winger I‚Äôve ever seen. Then when he transitioned to midfield he was incredible. The way he played under Fergie was more of a right-sided central midfielder and there are people who compare him with the current game‚Äôs right-wingers, which is an unfair comparison.",
            "Until 2001 Becks was one of the very best midfielders in the world. After 2001 he was still top tier, but arguably not quite world class anymore. But he was top tier for another 8-9 years after his very best spell, so hard to criticise him overly. He didn't fall off to the same degree as someone like Owen did.",
            "Yes, he gets thrown Into the ‚Äúdeadball specialist‚Äù pile, but he was so much more than that. Massive stamina and work rate great, team player excellent passing ability and great on field vision, and obviously an amazing crosser. Lacked that extra yard of pace but that wasn‚Äôt his game anyway.",
            "Beckham made me LOVE United! So yes he was good!",
            "Beck‚Äôs isn‚Äôt a national treasure‚Ä¶.he‚Äôs a worlds treasure",
            "Is that even a question! David Beckham was absolutely awesome! One of the greatest players of all time.  And ostracised by that Italian tit that unfortunately managed England.",
            "I used to think he was too slow and slowed the game down with his long cross field passes. It‚Äôs only when he left I realised how much we missed that ability / vision to switch the play and stretch opponents. It‚Äôs worth more than pace.",
            "Beckham today would be a cheat code for many teams. His pin-point crossing is totally out of this world and would give strikers many free goals for his team. He also has world class freekicks, setpieces, work rate and most accurate long pass on the pitch.\n\nI think De Bruyne is one player who would be playing most similar to Beckham in current era.",
            "Hard worker read that Sancho you lazy twat also great technique",

            "Somehow underrated because of his fame people underestimated him.",
            "His crosses to RVN were a thing of beauty. Pin point accuracy most of the time, and you always had this feeling Ruud was going to slot them away.",
            "He was a key player in one of the best teams in premier league history. He‚Äôs be head and shoulders above anyone in our team today",
            "Fact",
            "Agreed",
            "Robben is another prime example of exactly this phenomenon",
            "I think the video does a great job of highlighting exactly why he wasn't a one-trick pony \nE.g. his workrate was quite literally being off the charts. His ability to excel in a more central position later in his career, to the point whereby he may arguably have been better suited all along.",
            "It‚Äôs like saying Haaland is a one trick pony because he only scores inside the 6 yard box with mostly his left foot",
            "He wasn‚Äôt even a one trick pony. Beckham was one of the most unique player ever because of his kicking ability.",
            "At least he was a one trick pony who did that trick exceptionally well. Hard to think of someone else, there are but not a lot, who can curl a cross in from deep as well as Becks. Not to mention he was great at freekicks too. During an era where wingers commonly play deeper than this era, he most certainly was top class at what he does.",
            "Yah, like Wayne Gretzky was the best, but people also loved that he was surprising and did sorta untraditional things. Like he could weave a pass or get an assist from the most unlikely plays. It was exciting. The only thing surprising about Ovechkin is that he can remain such a powerhouse at his age. He is just good at hockey, big, strong, and plays straightforward attacking forward hockey better than probably anyone. Like you said, everyone knows what he is trying, but he can still make it happen despite that.",
            "Haaland last year‚Ä¶..",
            "He had an amazing ability to pass the ball with amazing accuracy. In football. If that's a one trick pony, so is anyone who can run fast or shoot the ball well. He's great because of the chances he was able to create. When you can consistently put the ball in dangerous places, isn't that pretty damn good? Even better when when you can do it from a distance? Now add some crazy spin with the same precision. Pretty fucking amazing if you ask me. He's so underrated because people expected him to score goals which wasn't the priority of the position he played. This same reason why defenders won't win the Ballon D'or, it's not flashy enough for the mouth breathing masses.",
            "Worth the read",
            "i personally think Becks was our Best player in the treble season, however he wasn't even voted the best player in our own club awards that season.",

            "Kanchelskis was a regular from day one, and he could swich over with Giggs or Sharpe because as you said, they all had real pace, that would've probably continued but Becks was slower than my gran",
            "i hate all that stats nonsense, i see things with me eyes, Becks was fantastic but Juninho Pernambucano was on another level.",
            "Becks is the reason I even became a United fan. I remember playing FIFA 2001 at the ripe age of 5 and there just being something that drew me to United and specifically Beckham, I just loved him. Will always be my favorite player, just had everything for me.",
            "I gotta know what time frame you‚Äôre thinking when you say ‚Äúlately‚Äù",
            "The golden ball comment may help to fix that lol",
            "Surely at least open to debate?\n\nBest Giggs was a one man army that no one could stop. \n\nThe issue with Giggs was his consistency and off field nonsense.",

            "No, I agree it does. All I am saying is when people write him off as a one trick pony, my response is, well, how come no one stopped him then? Because no one was good enough to stop him from crossing the ball perfectly.",
            "Exactly, he excelled in a 442 in a time when fast tricky wingers were the done thing. He'd have been absolutely wild as a cam or inverted winger in a 433 system.",

            "He wasn't better than Keane in 99 imo. The United POTY in 1999 was Keane and I'd take that more seriously than what a bunch of journalists, most of which probably didn't even have TV access to the PL in 1999 voted for.\n\nThe Balon D'or was also really weird before the mid 00s. \n\nOwen won it in 2001 scoring 16 league goals and winning a UEFA Cup.\n\nGeorge Weah won it in 1995 scoring 7 league goals for PSG and not even winning Ligue 1.\n\nBeckham was a world class player but there's no way anyone can pretend he was ever seriously the best player in the world.",
            "Having just gotten thru the first half of the documentary on Netflix. I think you're right because his treatment after the red card was much worse then I remember and went far longer. Mental that he was able to put in good performances with that type of pressure.",

            "His mentality gave him his footballing ability. He worked harder in training than just about anybody else, he struck the ball as well as he did because he practiced relentlessly. And then he had the steel to go out and execute in matches over and over again, despite the hatred for 1998, despite the taunts about his wife and his sex life, despite the distractions offered by fame. He won the respect of Real Madrid fans because he worked and worked and worked to master the central midfield role and become an essential part of the team that finally won La Liga again.

            "Agreed. It's also what got him through the abuse.",
            "He'd be like (and no this is not an exact comparison so don't jump down my throat) like Antony in our set up, he'd be part of the front 3 and would still be a huge outlet going forward, you'd just see his harassing and pressing players all down the right side",

I appreciate the documentary because for years I‚Äôve felt Beckham is under appreciated by football as a whole which is understandable but even by our own fans which is shocking.  Maybe most people here really became fans after he left or were too young to remember what a footballer he was.  No idea why you‚Äôre so triggered by this discussion.",

The brand will look like a single misshapen lump, because the area will be burned to full-thickness and lack any kind of definition. \n\nIf you're branding through hair and thick hide it makes sense, but even then contact isn't held very long. \n\nIn a nutshell, if you want to \"brand\" yourself without just ending up with a big blob of a scar, the metal only needs to be around cookie-cutter thickness if heated to cherry-red as steel (Still around 1200-1400 degrees) and only held for 1-2 seconds of firm contact. If you need more definition of the scar, how you treat it post-injury is the more important factor, not how much heat and initial damage you cause with the branding.",

(admittedly i wrote per gram, but i guess this is my redaction after the peer review :) ). among solid materials though they do have great volumetric thermal capacity. In general, liquids and gasses have much higher thermal capacity per mass unit than solids. hydrogen gas for example has a truly exceptional heat capacity per mass (much greater than water), however it is impractical for ***most*** common heat transfer and storage applications.\n\nso i guess my thought process when i wrote it was that for solid materials, metals can in general be considered to have pretty high volumetric thermal capacity, especially when compared to a super lightweight insulator material [like the one used in the space shuttles thermal tiles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp9Yax8UNoM) :)",

One is often flying by the proverbial seat of your pants when figuring out how to make some pieces, but some of the most important skills would be:  \n-Wood and plastic working with table saw, drill, milling machine, lathe, etc.  \n-Painting using airbrush (including big spray guns) and detailing with brushes and enamels, latex, or even craft paints. Faux finishes like weathering, metal, rust, and burnt wood are commonly needed.  \n-Casting and mold-making for resin or expanding soft foam items (made lots of those!)!  \n-Foam carving with rigid foam using hot wire cutter, saws, etc.  \n-Design software use, for laser cutting and 3D printing. This was something I didn't have available in earlier years, but it makes complex pieces so much easier and faster that it is a basic requirement for anyone going into models and/or props today.  \n-Basic electronics knowledge is an asset (thinking of the branding iron!).  \n  \nMostly, you have to think on your feet for best (and often fastest) way to do something.

Lots of weapons made of wood, bamboo, foam (including pool noodles and backer rod), barbed wire made of soft electrical wire and bits of leather - anything you could safely bonk a costumed stuntman/woman with!",

After that, but before I figured out that I‚Äôd hurt myself the entire class remarked how hungry they were cause they smelled a yummy barbecued meat smell and I‚Äôd also eventually start thinking the same thing, in about a minute or two I realised what I did and went; ah‚Ä¶.. the yummy smell was me‚Ä¶ and so thats the day I realised I‚Äôm delicious.

TW would have ripped the postman's arm off snatching the invitation if one had been sent to the olive garden.\n\nThere's never been a question in my mind about where David's loyalty lies, he was just gracious enough to let his pal include a younger brother, back when the pal wished it.",

I'm not a fan but he's a good choice. He desperately wants that K and he's arguably done far more for the country than many many others who have one so if he gets one fair enough. He does do a lot to raise the UK profile he's got global name recognition and he'll do a good job. \nThe queuing to pay respects to HMTLQ I'm not going to give him any more credit for than anyone else that queued. I don't believe he was offered an opportunity to skip the queue I think that was PR but I do think he did genuinely want to pay his respects like thousands of others. He's a young fit man who doesn't have a boss to answer to. There were many who had to take a day's holiday or unpaid leave to do it and a lot of them were much older than him. He us smart enough to know that if he had been offered the chance to queue jump and take it he would have been slaughtered in the media. \nDavid has got where he has got to by having talent being handsome working hard and most importantly by listening to very good PR and business advice.  These are all qualities Harry lacks. They should have studied the Beckhams very closely. They are expert players of the game. It's no accident that VB is the most successful of the ex spice girls. The documentary was a very good advert for them.",

            "God, I hope this was sarcasm. The Beckhams are not popular, at least in my part of the UK. They live their lives on Social Media and David is desperate for a title on the King's Honour list. The only problem is he was found to be practicing dodgy tax evasion practises. Their public persona took a drive when his emails about this situation were published (he states his email was hacked). They're still pushing to be accepted by the 'establishment'.",

            "What took my breath away was that before Beckham flew all the way to Australia and Harry would meet with him, the Beckhams had lent the Harkles their fully  staffed house in Beverly Hills for a few days. The Harkles didn‚Äôt thank them! I would bet heavily on the fact that they didn‚Äôt thank it tip the staff either.\n\nTalk about no good deed going unpunished.",

They didn‚Äôt want their presence to overshadow the Beckham‚Äôs wedding and the media accusing the Beckhams trying to rub shoulders with the BRF. Also, William and Catherine are now ambassadors and the face of UK, they can‚Äôt just attend any public functions without drawing attentions to themselves.

            "American here and you hit the nail on the head. I heard of the Beckhams but didn‚Äôt know anything about them other than he played soccer and she was in a band. I watched the first episode and instantly loved both of them. Oh, and David‚Äôs parents. His mum is a total love ‚ù§Ô∏è",
            "My kids all played American soccer‚Ä¶ I lived in Europe about 40 years ago and would go to some soccer games which always turned into a drunken brawl so I saw little of the game and didn‚Äôt stick around that long.  I don‚Äôt follow the Beckhams but they‚Äôve managed to stay together and raise a family that seems to have turned out ok‚Ä¶so that‚Äôs commendable‚Ä¶and in the little I‚Äôve seen of their documentary they seem pretty cool..soüëç",

            "Yeah exactly!  I‚Äôve heard the names.  I love Keira Knightley and watched Bend It Like Beckham, and yes my own kids even played soccer, to which I really paid not much attention to the actual game. (Also an American- we parents would usually end up chatting among ourselves)\n\nSo it was a good doco for me!  I really didn‚Äôt know much about either.\n\nI do fear for their son Brooklyn with his wife‚Ä¶ she certainly seems another Meghan type, of which we have so, so many in this country.",
            "Same. There have been times I've literally had to choose between feeding myself or my cat (I always choose him. He's my best friend!) There are two wars going on and cost of living for the average pleb is out of control. No one except mentally ill Sugars or evil billionaires like Oprah give two sh*ts about the Harkles' \"problems\"!!",

Oh and WHYYY can shahid not button up his shirt üôÑ Also I think although sonam is dressed appropriately, The saree and the heaviness or whatever its called is apt the jewelry is apt for the occasion too but this Blouse ‚Ä¶I think she shoudl just ditch these blouses completely - that alone makes her attire look bad.",

            "Honestly, I think David is underdressed. The pictures of the party and the decor on Sonam's Instagram stories give a beautiful eclectic maximalist vibe. The table setting, flowers, and antique stuff is quite beautiful. Idk if there was a dress code but Sonam, Anand, Rhea, Mallika and Karishma are dressed very much in tune with the setting of the party. Even Shanaya somehow comes close but the whole panty-sheer dress is overkill. Mira and Shahid look nice but seem mismatched with the overall vibe of the party. I love Rhea and Sonam's looks.",
