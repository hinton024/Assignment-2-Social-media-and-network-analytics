            ">if you were born rich, so what?\n\nA lot of rich people are capable of intuiting how gross it is to have been born rich, so weaving a false narrative of humble beginnings or hard work is a way to try to convince others that you're one of the rich people who \"deserve\" to be rich.",

            "Its an ego problem. Being rich, in their mind, often gives them the right to feel ‘above’ others. If they somehow ‘legitimately’ found a way to be wealthy when they were at the bottom while hundreds of other people didn’t that, to them, is all they need to start being self congratulatory elitists. \n\nAnother way to look at it- they purposefully forgot life starts with the cards you’re dealt and sometimes you get a bad hand and play it well with the luck and wit you’ve found and sometimes you’re dealt a hand so good no matter what you do you’ll win (rich kids) on paper. They’d like you to think they started with a similar hand to you. Rich kids/people that were given their wealth hate this reality because it totally fucks up the idea that they are deserving of their status.",
            "Idk. They all do it for some reason. There was a girl who said her family was working class and she worked her butt off to get into an Ivy League with great scholarship. I was like, good for you. Then I found out her family sent her to a glitzy private school in Switzerland for many years.",
            "Perhaps unpopular opinion, but there is a a lot of hate towards rich people. Ex: when the sub imploded near titanic people where making fun of it online even when their deaths were not even confirmed. It was jokes about how they deserved it etc and it was being upvoted a lot as well. I think some rich people are ashamed that they are rich. I think they are because they know how many people feel about rich people.   Personally, I think that rich people hate is kind of sad because it comes from jealousy and the sense that all rich people somehow got that money in an unfair way. \n\nEven if you were born super rich, you should not have to be ashamed of that. Being rich and an asshole, however, should be shameful however. Being poor and an asshole should also be shameful.",

            "A lot of people here are ignoring the UK context where class is treated, to some extent, as an inherited thing. Her dad was an electrician and her mum was a hairdresser, so it's fully possible that they considered themselves and their family to be working class. The fact that a working class person hits it big and builds a business doesn't, in most cases, change their class identity. The degree to which that's then passed down to the kids is debatable, but if the wealth wasn't always there, and only came into the family at some point during childhood, many kids would still maintain a stable view of the class they are from. So there are a lot of potential layers here. It could be perfectly reasonable to say 'Dad was working class' even if he drove a roller at one point, or that the family was working class if that's how both parents identified. It's much harder for her to claim 'I am working class' if she grew up with wealth and a private school education, but she seems to be talking here about her family background more generally.",

Even then, you'd still get sniggered at by the people who didn't like you.\n\nPeople in the USA and most of Europe can't really appreciate just how cultural class tribalism was in the UK even 50 years ago.

            "Not so much, tbh. I was born in the south east of  England but moved to the East Midlands in my childhood, so I still have remnants of the “posh” sounding accent 35 years later and still get jokes about me being posh despite having lived in poverty my entire life. \n\nEqually, living in such a rural part of the country, I know plenty of middle and upper class people who have never spoken RP English in their lives.\n\nIt’s less about the accent and far more about the choices of wording. For example, an adult that still uses “Mummy and Daddy” to refer to their parents (other than ironically or because they want something from them) is a class signifier.",

            "what youre describing is class migration (or social mobility) where you move from one social class to the next. \n\na lot of people who move up from low working class (poverty line or below specifically) either cannot truly assimilate with their new class, or become obsessed with having money/status/material goods/etc. being a specific class isnt just about the money, sure, but if youre well into the top 1-5% then youre upper (middle) class regardless of how you were raised, the opinions you hold, or even how you personally feel. \n\nyou never truly assimilated ,which is fair, but youre still upper middle class if not straight up upper class since you’re quite literally part of the 1% (top 1% starts at around £180k/yr)",

They will be born into extreme wealth by the sounds of it, and enjoy all the benefits and connections that comes with. They will be amongst the wealthiest percentile in the country and will not have the working class struggles and experiences that you did. They will not grow up in or be familiar with the culture you grew up in. They will be middle class at best. \n\nIn fact, realistically even you probably don’t have as much in common with your working class friends as they have with each other because the level of wealth you have alienates you from the struggles and experiences they still live. \n\nThis is Victoria’s situation. Her parents are from a working class background, however they are not working class anymore. You can describe them as being from a working class background and self-made, but you cannot say they are working class, as their lifestyle will not be comparable to that of truly working class people. Victoria was born into and grew up in money, so she cannot claim to be working class at all, she can’t even claim to be from a working class background. The most she can say is her parents were from a working class background and self-made.",

            "I think if they hadn’t brought this up in a doc that’s specifically covering their relationship and family, they’d be accused of inauthenticity, so I can understand talking about it. \n\nI don’t really have an opinion on how they dealt with it. They individually and collectively decided how they’d stay together - not sure I’d have stayed in Victoria’s shoes but it was her choice to make.",
            "Watched this last night and thought it was good. The affair stuff was odd...they didn't really say anything that either confirmed or denied it, which in my eyes was kind of an admission that there was in fact an affair/affairs. I'm glad and impressed they didn't skip over the whole fiasco because I genuinely thought they would.",
            "I remember at the time not understanding why Victoria stayed with him. There was an interview with his mistress Rebecca Loos (who was their assistant) in which she said that Victoria once cried and told her she felt like she wasn’t pretty enough for David and was scared that he wasn’t attracted to her anymore. It broke my heart that the woman she opened up to would then go on to start an affair with him.\n\nIt always gave me the impression of Victoria utterly adoring David and him lapping it up. Especially as their relationship progressed and she wasn’t the most famous one anymore. \n\nBut now that they’ve been together for so long, it does seem like the love is definitely mutual and they are truly happy together. Watching the documentary, he definitely seems crazy about her as well.",
            "This whole thing is very weird. The way they both make it sound like it was something happening externally to them. The way David makes it sound like they were fighting against other people.\n\nDavid conceding to begin with that he was in Spain without his family and making you feel like... well, things happen.\n\nHe obviously cheated. It's interesting they both frame it like it was something other people did to them and not something David had to address himself.",
            "honestly, i feel like they’ve had an open or fluid relationship from the jump. i think the reason that this instance was more painful/specific was because of how sloppy david was about it. it ruined their image/brand and embarrassed victoria. i think THAT was the issue, and that’s why they keep projecting this as if the media is the problem vs the fact that david stepped out on her.",

And then they don't have to talk about it in public ever again if they choose not to.",
            "I really like them both but felt like he didn’t acknowledge his failing here. A lot of ‘new city, missed my family’ lines but not much accountability.",
            "There's this part where she says she comes from the working class and he says \"be honest!\"... I just wish she would do the same to him because so many words to say you're a cheater without saying it is so ridiculous but she would never do that.",
            "tbh i always thought they had some sort of open relationship had a result of this affair specifically...",
            "It bothers me that he didn't have an answer for how they survived as a couple. His 'don't know' speaks volumes to me. He could have said they tried therapy, or had long talks, or decided to put the children first. I realise he's skirting around the issue and trying not to admit to anything, but did he really just wait for Victoria to forgive him? Because it kind of sounds that way.\n\nI guess she could be in the marriage for 'the brand' but I hope not because that kind of life sounds miserable.",
            "I still don't believe him. I feel really bad for Vic but the way she seems aloof to emotions makes people think that she doesn't have feelings to begin with. And that is so sad how people have never considered her as someone who deserves love like we all do but have treated her bad.",
            "There was no way that they could have not said anything about this. They had to address it somehow. The Beckhams have always claimed David never \"cheated\", but what's their definition of cheating? Because clearly something happened from what they have said here. Maybe not physical - hence they can hold on to the \"never cheated\" claim - but maybe an emotional affair?",
            "I really felt for VB in this. The way he sprung uprooting them multiple times. Like he would of known from the first time how unhappy it made her and then did it again. It just came across as really selfish. Here’s a successful woman in her own right wanting stability for her family but willing to stick by him through thick and thin. Very admirable and great to see the success she’s had in her business through all this regardless",

            "Im British, the Rebecca Loos Affair was huge in the papers at the time. However, we’re all now in middle age and although I’m not excusing affair, you can as a couple, choose to move beyond them. \n\nI think their attitude is more like British aristocrats. The family and the image is more important. If the late Queen of England could deal with Prince Phillip having had mistresses throughout their marriage, the VictorBeckham certain can. His wealth also subsidises her fashion brand. They have taken turns in supporting each others’ dreams.\n\nin the 90s and early 2000’s, David Beckham was a rockstar. «Michaelangelo’s David » was an apt moniker. Victoria had no choice, but to agree to what David wanted. Now, their children are grown and the relationship seems more balanced.",

I usually don't believe them, but this is the first time I gotta say \"Yep, they have an open marriage lol\". The way they frame it (us Vs them) is less \"oops cheating\" and more \"oops our secret got out\". It seems to be more a problem of public image than breaking marriage vows.",
            "you “survived” that because victoria is ridiculously smart and a manager of wealth and she knew she wouldn’t get a better option than you…\n\nand on the other hand  you also felt deep down you wouldn’t get a better option than her, someone that truly values you and layered bricks upon bricks to make you as famous and loved as you are and is such a smart cookie",
            "I think it’s very known how he still cheats and has a whole mistress. They are just such a brand they can’t separate.",
            "I would have had more respect for him if he just took direct accountability and apologized for his actions and they talked about how they moved on from it or something.",
            "They’re an interesting couple. I think they’re trying to build momentum to have their own reality show. They’d like to see their children be successful and have their own careers and money and perhaps see that as a vehicle.",
            "It’s a weird way of dancing around saying he had an affair. Shit and get off the pot, why talk about it if they aren’t going to say he was fucking about?",
            "I can't help but wonder...why even bring it up if there was no truth to it?  And why be so \"hurt\" if there is no truth to it.  I've heard crazy rumours about myself (and I am definitely no one famous) and they are hilarious.  If it weren't true, my husband and I would have laughed our asses off and said nope not true.  Maybe it isn't true and they are just trying to fuel interest in Season 2 by dancing around it.  They are business people above all.  I also wonder why this rumour was never ever discussed in a \"me too\" setting. She was their employee, a personal assistant.  Why is it that with David Beckham we talk about it as an \"affair\", like she was their next door neighbour or fitness trainer, which is so different from how we talk about these situations now - I guess it was a different time. The whole employer/employee things puts a creepy spin on it.\n\nI don't doubt that there was some genuine attraction between them, but I did get a weird feeling when he said he was going to marry her after seeing her on TV.  Do men even talk about women that way? It reminds me of women in the 50s saying \"He's a dreamboat, I am going to marry him\".  Maybe UK men are different, but I can't imagine many of the men I know speaking that way. And the way he talked about her when he was told she was one of the SGs at the game.  Very creepily strategic.\n\nAnd no doubt he is a man with a big appetite for everything - food, cars, clothes, houses, women...men with appetites like this want to consume it all.",
            "I'm surprised they even alluded to this time in their marriage because most people forgot about this scandal by now. Why do I feel like it's preemptive damage control? Is more gonna come out about David? and they are trying to get ahead of it",
            "Can't believe people think he cheated this one time. He STILL cheats. They are a BRAND. Their lives depend on it.",
            "I don't think he cheated.  But I also don't care.  If she doesn't, why should I?  Always wondered why the public gets so caught up in this.  She stayed with him, it's not for me to judge it.  I know nothing about their private life.  Y'all getting all psychological on her...really?",
            "I hope they've been to therapy, but I doubt it.",
            "Wow that was supremely awkward. I feel like they both kept talking about didn’t really say anything at all.",
            "I think she has a poor self value. And she clearly loves him, but i dont think he does, he's clearly there for the kids.",
            "Their marriage was a business deal.  Obviously they bonded and love each other but if they weren’t rich or successful they would have never wanted each other.",
            "They are both bland and tiresome. No need to watch that stuff.",
            "where can i watch for free?",
            "Literally, neither of them confirmed it. However, everyone is once again 100% certain it happened. He may have, he may not have. The internets certainty about information with zero facts because they watched a new fucking Netflix series is surreal.",
            "It felt like it was mentioned because to completely ignore it would seem strange, since it was a big deal at the time. But, they are entitled to privacy in their marriage. I'm sure it was a terrible time (especially for Victoria, whom I love) but if they managed to get through it and are happy now, that's all that matters. Besides, this documentary was more about David's career, not to drudge up the drama.",

Everyone will speculate, and I bet there are a handful of details that the public just has no business knowing. Why? So that we can shame his as a person again, or bash their marriage, or her? Nah. Let them be a family.",

And then you get to that country and you find out he's been having an affair. That is emotional turmoil, and I feel so bad for Victoria Beckham she looked like she was still ready to break down when she was talking about it. I had severe PPD after my pregnancy and if I had been dealing with all those circumstances, I don't think I would've made it through to the end honestly.",

And this includes potential affairs on Victoria's end.

The man cheated coz he was lonely or he's a powerful man, a desirable man and they cheat but when a woman cheats, she's a whore, she's a train wreck, she broke the family. Like the man's cheating is marked as a tough time while the woman's cheating is marked as a disgusting event that only brings up contempt in those around her and in the world.",
            "I think that's a thing they're taught in PR training.\n\nI took a linguistic anthropology class, and one of the sections we dissected an interview with Lance Armstrong talking about blood doping. In his PR trained responses, it was always either external (something that was done to him) or so far in the past that it was like a different person (he often talked about *that* Lance). It was only when he was pressed or got flustered that he'd make \"I\" statements related to what he'd done. \n\nAnyway, they're responses here feel (to me) a lot like that kind of externalizing.\n\nThe other option, of course, is that it could be that that's how they cope. That that kind of externalization was what made it possible for them to move past it.\n\nI just assumed that, because they can afford it, they probably got training on how to frame it.",

            "It's because back in the days before everyone \"showing receipts\" people hoped to keep their private life private. Even celebrities. No matter your stance on the cheating, selling scandals to the papers and publicly blowing up a family is not cool. I would feel victimised if it ever happened to me or my husband too.",
            "It makes no sense that in 2023 David would prefer that people think he is a cheater than that they had a mutually agreed open relationship",
            "What a way to take away from his cheating by claiming they had an open relationship.",
            "At the time, it felt like most of the judgement went to Victoria,  cos she didn't move to Spain with him.",
            "I think it would have gone down better if David had held himself accountable, like \"I was sold from the club that I was with since I was a child, was in a foreign country where I didn't know the language and didn't have my family- and I made the biggest mistake of my life.\" Just at least an acknowledgment that he fucked up.\n\nMy impression is that they just agreed to stay together and never talk about it again and/or David will make sure to be more discreet in any future affairs. That being said, it's been so long since that whole brouhaha so I can see why Victoria seems so detached when talking about it.",
            "I disagree actually. Her experience of the affair is her own, and I understand why the judgment could be by far the hardest part.. Fidelity matters to differing degrees for everyone; for that matter, so does societal support. Maybe the infidelity wasn’t the worst part, but rather she thinks the most painful part was how they navigated it, and that the pressure on them to separate was the opposite of what she needed, and she just felt fucking lonely, and she is happy she and David are close again. I can kinda understand that.",
            "I get what you’re saying but this isn’t couples counseling, it’s a documentary they’re sharing with the word. The only person he owes an apology to is her and his kids and I don’t think we have to be part of that. We are part of the public response that made it probably 1000x harder for her to deal with it. I can see why she’d forgive her husband who she loves, but not the public who doesn’t know her.",
            "Someones feeling about an event is really the part the matters in the end. That is how we all process and understand our lives.",
            "Because its their private life, as he said. Since when is it ok for everyone to judge the inner workings of a marriage? \n\nI think what they are saying here is less about affairs but how the press really going after Victoria.",

The mistress outed him.\n\nHe and his wife both know it happened, and collectively decided not to acknowledge it.  He's obviously gross for having an affair.\n\nBut as soon as Victoria decided to forgive him and to refuse to acknowledge it, the mistress had already lost.  It's not clear why she wants the public to acknowledge the affair.  Why did she want anyone to know in the first place, 20 years ago?   In a weird way, it's not her business, now that Victoria has clearly let it go.",
            "Right? Like I need her to pop through a door and be like, “Be honest. What’s it you did, David? What’s it you did?” And then when he says “I had an affair” she just closes the door.",
            "Why should she though? She would have nothing to gain from him going on the record now and admitting it to the public all these years later. \nIf it did indeed happen, she obviously forgave him a long time ago. He doesn’t owe anyone other than his family any explanation or apology.",
            "Ugh shes one of those women with no backbone",
            "Yeah, I remember feeling like the tension in their marriage at that time was about the fact he’d slept with someone so indiscreet and so good at the media game, not that he’d slept with someone. \n\nWhen Loos first sold her story they just kind of batted it away like it was nothing and still seemed perfectly happy. The cracks started to show a couple of months later when the story was still everywhere and Loos was successfully parlaying it into minor celebrity status.",
            "There were serious rumors that she had an affair with Damon Dash. I remember reading about it at the time. FWIW, I’ve always thought they had an open relationship, mostly bc they’re ultra-wealthy.",
            "That's not how I took it - him saying 'I don't know' was like him admitting it was a miracle they made it, alluding to how bad they were. Not that he actually does not know how/why things improved.",
            "I interpreted his reaction here and him saying he didn't know as humility. I felt like his face said that he didn't think he deserved her forgiveness; like, \"I have no idea how she was able to stay with me\".",
            "What people think she doesn't have feelings? Those are horrible people. Just because someone is not outwardly emotionally expressive doesn't mean they don't have feelings, much less deep and painful ones. I bet one of the big reasons people feel free to be shitty to some women is this expectation to see emotional expression on women. And then of course if she were to ever break down, they'd declare the emotional reaction to be fake.",
            "I can’t blame her for being aloof. Showing hurt takes vulnerability and I can understand why she wouldn’t feel comfortable being vulnerable given the way she has been treated by the media at times.",
            "Aloofness makes me think they’ve gone through so much that it’s their way of coping",
            "There’s an old video of them, probably 15, 20 years old, in some interview or maybe it was a talk show. Victoria is incredibly humorous, and laughing all the time. Completely different to what she usually shows to the public.",
            "I always think she is very aloof in public but more honest in her private life.",
            "I think it's more of a conscious choice rather than aloofness. Victoria knows their brand is stronger as a couple. Also, his fortune ensures a great life for her and their children. Victoria was always the manager of their wealth (it is mentioned that before Victoria David spent all his money). Lastly, I read that VB's company is loss-making and David's company has put money in it to help. \n\nI think they love each other but as a couple they are rather superficial, they don't look into themselves that much (the director confirms this for David in an interview).",
            "I still think that’s why she doesn’t smile much. She’s possibly hurting on the inside and people instead judge her.",
            "I see a look in his eyes when he’s talking about it that looks like the cat that got the cream tbh.",
            "Which Brazilian in 2000?",
            "Americans do not hold this attitude at all. Makes me wonder if he would do the same for her if she was the one who publicly cheated….",
            "Ugh. \"The Crown\" kind of touched on Phillip maybe having affairs. I was hoping it wasn't true. I hope she had some as well, otherwise that's so shitty and one sided.",
            "Yeah I'm curious about how people can learn about the cheating and then claim that he's still clearly in love with Victoria. Why do people give David a pass like this? If it was any other male celebrity we'd be calling him out on his BS. How can you love someone but then cheat on them? These two things are entirely contradictory to me.",
            "No but that's actually why I find this clip juicy. At the time David insisted it was a lie, and Victoria publicly said she believed him. This clip makes it *so* obvious that he cheated, even if they didn't say it in absolute terms. He looks guilty af. Personally I take this as their first time admitting to everything.",
            "These people pay companies to scrub the internet of the things they don't want out there.  Ever wonder why we never see photos of  famous or wealthy people's children when they are in university/college?  In today's world where everyone has a camera on a phone?  I wouldn't be surprised if they have people working at promoting the funny working class commentary and squashing the affair commentary.",
            "I think these two legit love each other. Whether or not he cheats or has a pass, idk. Sometimes rumors are unsubstantiated but take hold because they fit our preconceived ideas. And sometimes a couple agrees that monogamy isn't a priority but public humiliation is. Thats their prerogative. Either way, you just have to see how they interact when they don't realize cameras are on them to know this is a real relationship.",
            "Imo - I hope that  Victoria enjoys seeing other men if  the allegations are true.",
            "And she stays ugh",
            "It’s really mind boggling seeing so many people say “they genuinely love each other” lol",
            "I've seen a lot of people say this on here. Where are you getting this from? Genuinely interested, not doubting",
            "This documentary has many people thinking this is an epic lovely marriage. And yes good for them for making it work through cheating, but it’s ironic how David gets a pass meanwhile other celebrity men who have cheated still get shitted on (and rightfully so ofc).",
            "I've heard she also has a boyfriend.",
            "I’d watch for sure",
            "I'm getting the vibe they had an open marriage but he fucked up by being really indiscreet. People weren't supposed to know about it.",
            "If they glossed over this part- there would’ve been a massive clamour about such a vital section being missed.",
            "How do you do a documentary with David Beckham without touching on his time in Madrid? You think the Taylor Swift effect is consuming oxygen at Chiefs games? You have no idea, lol. This was massive and the coverage didn't just sit in tabloid media. The fallout followed him to work.",
            "I felt the same, I had no idea about the affair. I think they mentioned it preemptively as to not lack authenticity. If they released the documentary without mentioning it we would find out anyway and would be talking about how the affair wasn't mentioned ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|shrug).",
            "I’m all over the place 😭. But thank you lol. It’s fascinating watching people say their relationship is  “real genuine love”. Although in the beginning I agree it was. But now…",
            "I mean, she's clearly saying that he hurt her with his actions and it was a bad time for her... that doesn't sound like she was thrilled or fine with what he did.\n\nThey clearly had different expectations in their relationship, and he violated her trust. No one is being pearl clutchy, they're just reacting to what she states.",
            ">This idea that there needs to be one person to meet our sexual and emotional needs for life is very new\n\nReally? I see it as the opposite. Historically people have absolutely been expected to have one life partner; 50 years ago it was difficult, if not illegal, to get a divorce. Some countries have only allowed it in the last 30 years. I think there's much more understanding now that \"lifelong\" or even long-term relationships are difficult. And there's definitely more understanding of polygamy than ever before, even if it's still seen as unsavory by a lot of people.",
            "No one is talking about non monogamy or saying anything is wrong with it.  \n\nI if they are in one then okay, good for them but they publicly appear to be very monogamous and we feel bad for her.   You ENM people really need to relax. No one is prosecuting you. You are not a marginalised group",
            "tbf i saw people talking about this stuff first.  not defending her but i think people have just been waiting for them to address the situation for a while now",
            "I feel like if he were to cheat it wouldnt be out of maliciousness and playboyness. I think it was due to sheer loneliness and reaction to the struggle in Manchester and Madrid. What was done to David in England is truly traumatic, and he probably did really need the support from Victoria, but it also isn't fair to expect her to drop everything. Being in that world is far more emotionally complicated than people let on. And it didn't seem like he was cheating with club rats... He was alleged with women who were close to him in his everyday life, like his PA... though she seems like a clout-seeking attention seeker. \n\nOverall, it's extremely complicated, but not an excuse to cheat on your wife. He should have been forthright about his struggles in Madrid with Posh :/ I still stan them though.",
            "Very wise, truly.",
            "Exactly, people have different ways of coping and different standards.",
            "What’s dark sided mean",
            "Source?",
            "How you know?",
            "I’ve heard this too! Apparently they’re life partners but he’s known to cheat",
            "Then again a lot of men who only think with their dicks and cheat on their significant others don't. They want to place the blame on everything else instead of themselves and their egos.",
            "The last thing I want to do is hurt you...but it's still on my list.",
            "What a slap in the face to her when he says he has noidea how they got through it.",
            "Exactly what made my blood boil. And from what I recall Rebecca Loos wasn’t the only woman he cheated on her with.",
            "I couldn't agree more. You got through it because of your wife's GRACE, because SHE chose to put the family first when you couldn't. Absolute idiot.",
            "This makes me sad, I always remember in the spice girls book I had growing up she was particularly open about struggling with depression. It seems like being expected to ‘deal’ Is something she’s experienced a lot in life.",
            "So much this. When he lost the world cup the first time he flies to New York with her and the Spice Girls and Victoria was talking about how they protected him while he was there and made sure he was ok etc. But then you see all of the mental warfare using her as the collateral damage that the fans would put her through and the media would put her through to get at David and you don't see him at all trying to protect her. Only for him to cheat on her and think of himself and his childish wants over his families needs.  What I took away from the documentary is not how great he is but rather Victoria is stronger than I would have been to deal with all of the things he put her through.",
            "I interpreted that as \"I **really** know how we got through it\" and David will surely agree from now on with what Victoria says - there you see the example of how they didn’t stay in Spain.",
            "I always think this. I wonder how many celebrities have open relationships, and don't want to let the public into that knowledge for obvious reasons",
            "I think the embarrassment of how public it was, was the thing that annoyed her most. I do think they had a \"what happens on the road, stays on the road\" type understanding. Once that understanding was challenged publicly though, I'm sure it was rough for them. And I say them, because if it was an arrangement they both were okay with, then it's an issue they both had to deal with. \n\nAlso, I think it's easy when things are out of sight, out of mind. But when shit is staring you in the face, you realize that maybe that's not the life you want. I think that happened for them as well. I think he was incredibly embarrassed and remorseful over his actions. And I think Victoria probably realized whatever agreement they had wasn't gonna fly now that they were parents with a family to lose.",
            "I always doubted the him cheating story. \n\nThe way he talks about her having to go through it says she was hurt by the rumours, not by him.",
            "No.. they didn’t have an open marriage.. she was cheated on and was devastated.",
            "Yea he did say it was their private life at the end of that affair story. I was curious about the vagueness of it too but then I realized they probably didn't wanna tell the public everything so I guess we'll never know.",
            "True, but Jada got more attention because she slept with one of her son's friends, and that she discussed it so publicly.",
            "IMO - I agree with you wholeheartedly. Like, the men are held to a different moral and ethical standard all together. It's ridiculous.",
            "It's weird the way people are microanalysis g every little thing and saying it's Jada continuing to humiliate him. Like her and Tupac dancing to one fo wills songs. Instead of reading that as her celebrating him and his work, it's her flaunting another man in his face 🙄",
            "ya but ppl could say whatever they want is the scary part",
            "An Australian model came forward. Can't remember her name but am sure you can find it on Google",
            "Yes it does lol. David would be labeled a “cuck.”",
            "that's so sad because it wasn't her fault",
            "Victoria has always been the one to cop the judgement. I still remember when they just had the boys and people were constantly acting like she’d failed because she hadn’t ‘given him a daughter’\n\nThere was a long standing rumour that he had a secret daughter and rather than it being about David being a cheater people would positively gloat that this other woman had supposedly given him the daughter he wanted, something Victoria had failed atp",
            "I think you are right. And I do think they have an agreement in their relationship. I think that extends to Victoria too, not just him. Thats the word on the street.",
            "I don't disagree with the bulk of your comment but IMO: Accountability is owed to the people involved that have been hurt. This gets difficult when you're famous, for example people who harm their fans owe the public accountability in terms of open acknowledgement (validating survivors, etc.). But in this case, he cheated on his wife. He owes her the accountability, not the \"public\".",
            "i totally agree",
            "I don't think he's denying it. Its a known fact anyway. To the extent that the mistress went on a reality show just on this basis. He's focusing on the fallout because that's the question on the table.",
            "I’m gonna use that as code for saying someone cheated  from now on. So and so “moved to Spain” together",
            "Exactly. 🗣️",
            "that would be iconic",
            "??? I never said she should, I said I wish. And it was because of the “be honest” part. I linked both in my mind. That's all. \n\nAnyone who knows the Beckhams, how are they publicly, watched their old reality show, etc., knows that she would never say that, Victoria is not like that. So much so that I even said she wouldn't do it.\n \nAnd I know he doesn't owe anyone but his family an apology, but they keep talking about it after all these years, so we keep talking too.",
            "Rebecca Loos was a bloodhound. She wanted fame for fucking a dude. \n\nI mean, imagine being a Spice Girl and you are married to the most famous footballer in the world. Things are going to go topsy turvy at some point, but to have someone sell a story that they had sex with your husband, and they probs had sex with your husband simply to sell that story in the first place.\n\nThat's just another layer of desperation and decadence.\n\nI don't know why I feel so strongly about this! It's more than 20 years ago and it's about a Spice Girl! Crikey!",
            "In watching the doc, you definitely see her going from being so silly on camera during the Spice Girls days, to being very stoic now.  Hearing her discuss the amount of turmoil they went through with the press and the paparazzi and the threats to their baby once he was born may play a factor in the change in her outward appearance.  I don't know one way or another, but this is me guessing just based on what I'm seeing.  She certainly seems to have very strong feelings, but I think perhaps she just stopped giving the public anything when she started to feel fearful and attacked by the public.  I certainly can understand that, and would probably take on that same form of armor if I were in her shoes.",

            "Definitely. I was looking at old pics from the late 90s of her on Getty and she was full tooth grinning in the majority of them. Only a few years later and she was constantly mocked for never smiling. Women who show emotion aren’t treated well by the media, it’s always so nice to see the real her in these types of things.",

            "This 100%! I got more and more furious as the episodes went by. He's such a selfish petulant child who needs everyone to catter to his needs. To him, his wife and kids are just something to fall back on, support him emotionally and make him look good. He never would have had this career if it wasn't for Victoria carying all the mental load. And even after all of that, he still seems bitter towards her in every single exchange they have in the documentary. \n\nI can't believe people online are praising him, becauseI have a totally different takeaway from this documentary. I watched it thinking of all the women that were working overtime free labor, just to allow these sports events to happen. Victoria is just one of them. And then we're in 2023 and they complain about the lonely men epidemic?! This documentary is a good exemple of why woman chose to be single over caring for a man as the more difficult child of the family.",
            "I think Spain was too much for Victoria from the get go as she stated her dislike of being there (she denies it but I thought it was odd when the tabloids in Spain published that Victoria said it smells of garlic there as an insult, heh). David seemed to be uncomfortable there as he didn't have his family in the way he had prior, didn't speak the language and so on. He also said that his manager told him he will never play for Spain again when he thought David was speaking to other scouts or whatever he called them, and then went to the US.",

But in this video, David's cheating is being defined as this big problem that they had to get through like this man had cancer or some shit. He chose to cheat.

In india, an actor known as shah rukh khan cheated yet its talked about as if he's such a great man for going through this difficult cheating on his wife situation and coming out of it stronger.",

They must have been picking on every little thing she did. I’ve heard of old school people being upset about not getting a son, but not having a daughter? Interesting.

            "Came here to say what you said. \n\nI am autistic and I am lucky to blend in fairly smoothly by comparison. One of the biggest differences and honestly challenges I notice when interacting with people is that they treat me like I have no emotions since I don't seem to show them very much outwardly. Or that I don't need help in situations where anyone would need help - just because I don't look \"needy\" I guess? \n\nIt can be downright dangerous in medical contexts when people, even professionals, disregard your pain/distress like that.

            ">Just because people were married to one person and couldn’t get divorced doesn’t mean that people were getting all their needs met by a single person\n\nNo of course not but it was still the \"expectation\" until pretty recently. All the naughty extra-marital stuff was incredibly hush hush. Your examples support what I'm saying and it still happened just 60 or 70 years ago (or less in the most traditional countries). I'm not surprised society hasn't quite moved past that mindset, even though it's improving. \n\nIf we look at the entirely of human history then okay, lifelong monogamy wasn't an expectation until far down the line. But we know for sure it goes as far back as the Bible, since it describes marriage as sacred and extra-marital sex as sinful.",

It’s likely if they’d had all girls people would have just switched the argument around\n\nAgreed such a strange time. I have a big soft spot for Victoria and think she gets a lot of unfair criticism. When you see her interviewed etc she always come across as a warm person with a good sense of humour. It’s just that she doesn’t really do many interviews so people take her stoicness as her being cold. Honestly she seems about as harmless a celeb as there is",

            "Exactly! She even mentions therapy I think in the last part of the documentary. To me, she came off overall as someone who had learned to compartmentalize a lot of the crap he did. She even says she internalized a lot of frustrations because she didn’t want to affect his playing (RE him messing up the game she was pregnant). He also came off as someone who was very needy/codependent. Heck even Gary said how becks could not function if posh wasn’t around. I actually saw the relationship in a new light from the documentary.",

In basketball whenever someone gets fouled the game gets paused and a player shoots two free throws, meaning no defense. Dennis Rodman was notoriously bad at shooting free throws, but miraculously whenever he needed to hit them, he usually did. His explanation was that free throws were boring and he wanted the game to continue.\n\n2. Before games Dennis Rodman would count the amount of times his teammates ball spun in the air during a shot instead of warming up himself. If a ball spins more it has more backspin and will therefore bounce more \"straight\".\n\nProbably way more examples and reasons, but those are my favourites.",

            "I had absolutely no opinion of beckham until the Qatar thing, and now, who could give the slightest of shits about this arsehole?\n\nWho cares about his success if he can't even have any principles any more, the daft fuck",
            "You were the first search when I googled \"is David beckham autistic\"\n\nThe fixation on football, struggling in mainstream school, issues understanding other people's emotions, just many moments have me wondering if he's on the spectrum. \n\nI'm only on the second episode and it's so sad that his mistake brought on so much anger and he dealt with death threats and people hating him and he almost when dissociative to manage.\n\nWhether he is or isn't- shows his character he went through all that and is still one of the most influential footballers of our time x",

            "My dad is definitely autistic (as is a lot of his family, one of those situations where it kind of became normalized and most grew up to be successful so it’s like “some kids just don’t talk until kindergarten it’s fine”) and sports are 100% his special interest. It got him a D1 football scholarship but like no neurotypical person has every variation of multiple teams uniforms over the years memorized.",
            "Yeah, like I was watching some of the England football women’s team do interviews about their life and many of their answers about themselves and their childhoods scream ND.\n\nMary Earps the goalkeeper for instance was bullied constantly at school and felt like she never fit in and frequently “struggled to understand what was going on”. She felt like sports was an escape for her.\n\nThis is a story I hear over and over again in many highly successful athletes and musicians.\n\nHypermobility which is common in ND’s can also be very beneficial for sports and instrument playing.\n\nNikki Lauda is a bit different (racing driver) but I’m almost certain he was on the spectrum. \n\nHe was extremely stubborn and essentially cut ties with his family to pursue F1 racing. He would push himself and his car mechanics to the limits to always do better. His ex wife described him as an “asshole” who was very logical, perfectionist, analytical but emotionally unavailable and cold. He admits that he doesn’t have many friends. He said “I hate gray areas, I only think in black and white”. \n\nAlex Honnold is almost certainly on the spectrum too.\n\nIf channeled correctly and with the right circumstances, the black and white/all or nothing thinking, perfectionism, stubbornness and obsessiveness/hyperfixating tendencies of ND’s can help in achieving huge success in fields like sport.",

They declined.\n\nThey then receive another phone call from the venue saying they are willing to pay off their mortgage in exchange for those dates.

The calls became more insistent and the fact that they weren't keen on giving up their wedding date they came to the figure 100,000 in their heads as they figured it was obviously someone wealthy behind it.\n\nA friend of theirs suggested they do some research and see if there are any celebrities who it would make sense for it to be, they thought Taylor Swift initially as she was performing in Dublin last week.

Messi miss a lot of important games for the first team during his youth years because he was doing exams and more. There is even a picture of young Pep doing calculus and vectors lol.  Lamine Yamal for example was doing classes while playing at the same time , specially during the Euros lmao. Another example is Fermin who finished secondary school and also  persuaded and study a program while he was playing on 3rd division , not only that but Ferming was thinking on not persuading football anymore if he could not break into a first division team at his age , and then Xavi recognize how much talent and potential he got and the rest is history. \n\n- Manchester City youth academy have to prioritize studies over football first. Even legends of United like Rooney put his son on City academy because other than having a better structure , it puts education before football. \n\n- Other incredible players have study university before playing full time , study after they finished playing profesionally or have being juggling between the two of them. Robin Van Persie actually study at a university when he was playing in the Netherlands before he move to Arsenal iirc , Juan Mata study university while he was playing in Valencia and finished them when he was at Chelsea if i am not wrong , Van Der Saar study accounting after he retired from United and work for his first club , Iniesta study on the INEF while he was playing at Barcelona , this was meme a lot but Robert Lewandowski have a degree on physical education but \"rumors\" mentioned that he paid for it  (this was around 2017) , Fabregas was studying business management during his academy years in Barca and first years in Arsenal , Azpilicueta studied \"sport media and entretaintment\" from Harvard university lol.

Huge trophy cabinet. Elite crossing, passing, and especially work rate. A dead ball specialist (still has the EPL goal record). Could turn and progress the ball at a VERY high level.

Being exceptional at only set pieces and crossing isn't going to achieve all of that. Otherwise, guys like Juninho would've been right up there with him with the accolades.\n\nYes, it's true he wasn't the most physically gifted or dynamic player you'll ever see, but even aside from his notable dead ball and passing skills, his football IQ, positioning, vision, and resilience were simply on another level from the vast majority of footballers I've ever seen.

It doesnt need to be profitable, they work their own hours, take months or years off, etc. Its not work how anyone would define actual work like the working class does.\n\nAs far as comments like a \"second hand Rolls Royce.\" Note a Rolls Royce is a $300k car. So even a used one is like a mortgage on a home. Even a doctor isn't going to be able to float a $250k car loan on top of home, student loans, and other bills.\n\nIts also worth mentioning that landed gentry isn't really a thing under capitalism. The lands back then were for farming where a lot of the money came from. Nowadays, farming isn't a big money maker. Investing, tech, finance, etc are. So if she's saying \"We didnt grow up on an old estate like the super rich,\" but instead in a beautiful London home, with clearly multi-millionaire parents, etc and its not really saying anything.

Historic family assets and education level is a better proxy than just £.\n\nFor example, Rupert the addict may be in and out of rehab with his drug problem but his family own 5% of the land in the UK and he went to Winchester - can't really be more upper class. Sophie is a teacher on an average wage, went to university like most of her family,  she's struggling to make ends meet, but her parents are accountants/lawyers with a pleasant detached house in a conservation area - solidly middle class. Darren the builder left school at 16, went into construction ended up with a successful construction business, now he's got a multi-million pound house and a McLaren in the driveway - still working class.\n\nIf there was an upper class social event, Darren might not be welcome were Rupert would be, because Darren isn't \"people like us\".\n\nThe other weird thing in the UK is you'll be able to tell most of this about someone in the UK within 30 seconds of speaking to them, just from the style of speech. It leads to strange scenarios were experts in a field may not be given due respect just because they speak like a pauper with a regional accent.",

These people dont want you to know the joys of having independence wealth because those joys are a burden on the working class. We're the ones cleaning her toilet, driving her car, serving her food, etc. Pretending class doesn't exist in capitalism is one of its greatest dishonesties.\n\nSo its a concentrated effort by a lot of people to hide how good they have it.

Beckham was making that point- while in her world, posh felt like her family was working class and had to earn more than others, but in *the* world she was being dropped off at private school in a Royce.

The difference being, the haute b. are those who are sufficiently established into ownership of things that they don't *have* to work. Though many might do so, the value of that work can be controversial: truly beneficial with utility for others, or it could be busywork akin to feuding warlords who while they might have kept busy, their 'work' was not useful to anyone but them and was not missed when they were gone. In contrast the petit bourgeoisie are those who might have some small ownership stake but nonetheless have to work to live.\n\n\"The definition of the thing\", mate, definitions do matter, but they are *descriptive* not prescriptive, folks have used the concept of class in many different ways over the years. In the modern era, yes, many folks would consider a successful business man or lawyer or whatever, to be upper class, especially if the have such a sum as to effectively establish multigenerational wealth going forward, trust fund babies, etc, who don't have to work if they don't want to (haute bourgeoisie).",

            "That's just wrong. Plenty of people move between classes all the time. It's not concretely based in \"lineage\" like you claim. A caste system would be a descendance only based system.\n\nMost aristocrats have some point in their family tree where someone made money in business or had good fortune and was made influential somehow, allowing them to make money and connections. While lineage is a strong currency in that part of society, that doesn't make it absolute.\n\nThe real issue that people have with it is that class is deeply cultural in countries like the UK. While you might not become a titled aristocrat in the UK without familial ties, that really only applies to a tiny percentage of members of the more influential, monied and powerful cultural cliques in UK society. You don't need a title to be upper class even if titles help.\n\nWhat class really consists in is a system of cultural exclusiveness that tries to vet the character of its members through a very opaque system of judgement. It is not grounded in the universalism of a \"we're all the same and of equal social worth and money is the determiner of our success and utility\" like \"new world\" capitalism. It's very much grounded in the idea that high class, \"high value\" people are of a certain cultural persuasion, most markedly in their accomplishment of remarkable things.\n\nPeople born into \"high class\" families have a unwarranted advantage in this cultural sphere since they are raised with different expectations of what matters if you are to succeed in this class-based system than others who are raised blissfully unaware of it.\n\nUltimately this is what angers people, since people are openly being judged on their characters by strangers according to a system of values that ordinary people simply do not have the ability to know. Who wants to be subject to appraisal by a bunch of elitists in order to process in society?\n\nSo while the tabloids and critics might makes remarks about Middleton's appropriateness for a royal title based on her lineage, she's in many ways ensured that her offspring will have unquestioned admission to the highest class society on the basis of their descendance as in 3 generations nobody will remember her grandfather was a coal miner, but will remember that her descendants had a princess in their family tree, which is how aristocracy works.",

While the media might not celebrate that part of US history and like to pretend that it has been a \"melting pot\" / \"don't begrudge a someone their success\" / \"meritocracy through hard work\" / \"it's not where you're from but where you're going\" type culture since its inception, pretty much all of these are inventions of the very late 19th and even more the early 20th century.   \n\nThe founding fathers were almost exclusively provincial Englishmen of a whiggish political leaning. The Whigs historically represented the deeply protestant English upper middle classes who made money in commerce and trade. I suppose that not being the true blueblood European aristocracy made them less dogmatically focused on breeding, but just because they didn't suffer from the same cultural hangover from the medieval period, didn't make them modern egalitarians in any respect.\n\nTheir extreme Protestantism made them very much look down on anyone who wasn't also a well established protestant. Much of Protestant theology was to do with the notion of divine providence and basically suggested that the rich and powerful were that way because they were righteous in the eyes of the Lord, while the poor were being punished for their moral failings. They were \"liberals\", but only in the sense of wanting to be left alone to practise their \"true\" faith and by extension being willing to leave other groups alone (who they essentially saw as heretical to greater or lesser extents, depending on their beliefs). They didn't marry or mix with people they saw as heretics. They didn't even want to owe them the kind of minimal civil duty of care that would have been expected in a European nation state.\n\nThe whole revolutionary ideology the US was founded on can be traced back to the liberty doctrines arising after the English civil war, which was won by whiggish protestant parliamentarians over the conservative royalists (who were sympathetic with Catholicism). That whole war was fought because the then monarch tried to raise taxes to fund foreign wars that were unpopular. There is a clear comparison with the American revolution and, heck, even the legal basis for \"no taxation without representation\" can be traced to that era. The core of the issue was religious pluralism and the degree to which communities within a nation state can be compelled, in the name of national collectivism, to aid other groups with whom they might not share a common religious or cultural identity.\n\nPower in the USA for the first century of its history remained almost exclusively with protestants of mostly British descent, with a few Dutch and Scandinavians thrown in since they often followed acceptably similar liberal protestant religious theologies. Even Germans weren't welcome at the table unless they were the right kind of Germans with the correct religious beliefs and backgrounds (most were Catholic while others were from more radical and impoverished strains of Protestantism e.g. Mennonites, making them unwelcome in the halls of power). \n\nIt was only when the USA came into its own as an industrial power in the late 19th century, after the ending of slavery, when suddenly a non-protestant could use his own culture's human capital to achieve commercial success, amassing fortunes that rivalled those of the land-owning agrarian pseudo-aristocracy, that anything like a \"melting pot\" situation started to arise in the USA. And while it was a melting pot of sorts, it was still deeply racist and culturally segregated along the lines of religion and heritage. The reason why most older and larger US cities have \"little Italys\" and \"Germantowns\" is because it was still effectively ghettoised. \n\nThe widespread acceptance of the melting pot ideology i.e. that anyone could make it in America regardless of culture and birth (provided they were broadly white European of course), didn't even take hold until even later, after WW1 with the romanticism of the roaring 1920s when the country became enamoured with the idea of throwing off European ways and customs and boldly asserting its own view of the world. You now had Catholics, Orthodox, and Jews making so much money that it was hard to maintain the premise that the US was nation controlled by liberal protestants. Nonetheless, even then families like the Kennedys had to fight, bribe, and marry their way into respectability among the dominant WASP class, and still look what happened to JFK as late as the 60s.\n\nUS education and Hollywood might not like to focus on this aspect of its own history and prefer to showcase the changes that happened later as a sign of its progressivism and freedom from \"old world\" nepotism, but like most national mythologies, it's exactly that... mythos, and anyone who's ever picked up a history book can tell you the same.",

            "What would they be? 50M wouldn't make them the same as your billionaires, those are your true upper class seeing as you have no lords or royalty. Old money vs new money aside, you would have to classify small business as being middle/working class imo."

Afterwards, it's back to all the \"FUN NOSTALGIA EVERYONE!\" It was the one interesting moment in the whole thing.\n\nI'm struggling to find the clip on Youtube, there's another one that keeps coming up which is all cheerful and is from a later part in the special.",

Like, the director can’t NOT control their subjects, it’s intrinsic. They could have cut this moment out but decided to leave it in. It wasn’t a live performance, they could have redone the take. The script itself might not be written, but everything that we are able to see and hear courtesy of the production crew, is a construction.",
            "That's... Not what a documentary is 99% of the time. From nature docs to political issues and band tour recordings, documentaries are almost always scripted and predetermined. Even small indie doc makers ask their subjects to repeat questions and retake their supposedly authentic and random activities. The authentic doc you describe has never existed, otherwise there wouldn't be directors making them. What you describe is CCTV.",

He didn't want to break Victoria's comfort or trust.  That's a good doc director.\n\nBut then he realized soon after that the moment eventually opened her up.  So he was angry at first, but obviously other things can change that and it made it into the series.  Also the sign of a good doc director.",

But go look at the emails that leaked and the tantrum he threw after his charity work didn't garner him a knighthood.\n\nDon't be fooled, he's a wealthy, ambitious businessman not some down to earth dude who just happened to kick a football well.",
            ">Showed how down to earth, human and honest Beckham is.\n\nHe's not honest at all though. This is the guy who claimed he'd spent time with the LGBT community in Qatar and that they faced no problems there, in a country where homosexuality is illegal. \n\nHe had to try to put a spin on it of course, working for the Qatari government after building a large part of your brand on being a gay icon wasn't a good look for him so he just lied through his back teeth about it. \n\nOh also, don't worry about the 6500 migrant workers who died building the stadiums for the world cup, Qatar paid Beckham loads of money to tell you that wasn't a real problem either. \n\nThe bloke is scum. Doesn't need the money at all but he'd still sell his own mum for it. Can't respect it.",

What’s left might not actually be your fave items, right? If she’d said “white is my favourite colour” I’d understand a bit better. Good for her anyway.",
            "It does seem to suit her really well as a colour & I understand the ease in terms of taking out all the choice & decision making once you’ve realised what works for you. I often find a look or a piece or a cut that really works for me but then I can’t just repeat that everyday as I’d be wearing the same thing everyday? So I feel really stumped how to make my style work whilst still wearing different stuff. \n\nBut yeah in realise I don’t see how it makes life easier for her past the decision making point when it’s such a hard colour practicality wise! I guess her life is easier to keep things clean? I wonder if she still wears other colours behind the scenes though when she doesn’t have to maintain her look.",
            "She's rich enough not to have to clean her own clothes",

            "It doesn’t fit with her desire to be seen as a serious fashion designer & not “playing” at it using her Spice Girls pop fame & her husband’s money so I can see why she doesn’t want to go back to that. \n\nHer stuff isn’t affordable to the average Spice Girl’s fans so it’s not like that would be likely to increase sales significantly either.",

            "Yeah lots of people do it; the only difference is they (Steve Jobs, etc) tend to stick to black and she chose white. It’s why some people liked having school uniforms; easy to get dressed in the morning.",
            "Sure, it makes sense for the majority of things you may want to wear. But she sticks EXCLUSIVELY to white. I find that really odd. What would she wear to a wedding? A funeral? Out in the fields with the horses? (Who am I kidding, she wore all white to an RBR shooting weekend). At that point, the choice is kind of limiting and IMO stupid.",
            "I've known many people who take this approach. Baz Luhrman said he either has all the same things at home or has an assistant decide for him so he expends zero mental energy until he gets on set where he can just unleash all his creativity at once.",
            "I want to know what she does with weddings!!! \n\nI wear a lot of white but I know when it's appropriate and when to mix it up. It's very impractical.",
            "It kinda makes sense. Wasn’t she the other woman in her husband’s previous relationship? \n\nOr maybe it’s a way to show her wealth? She’s so rich she doesn’t have to worry about ruining her clothes. Or maybe she just likes the colour?",

            "So I looked this up and her mom was a hairdresser and she and Victoria’s dad founded an electronics wholesale business. So I can see them going from lower middle class to wealthy during VB’s childhood.  Kind of like Kate Middleton, she grew up in a mansion, but likely remembers her parents budgeting earlier in her life. \n\nIt’s definitely a thing you’re aware of as a kid, but I guess she’s being taught self awareness now.\n\nETA: he apparently did grow up working class, so I get why he was adamant about it.",

            "One thing about class in the UK is that it is not that based on income or wealth, but more cultural indicators. So the dad could have done well in business, but still be working class. This would then usually change for the next generation who would go to nicer school etc.\n\nLike you can still hear the working class in David’s accent.",
            "Thank you. -Closes door - is my new favorite way to make a point.",
            "Her getting driven to school in a Rolls was one of the reasons she was called Posh Spice. But at the same time, they are still working class because the class system in England is not about money but lineage.  AFAIK, Posh's family don't have a signet ring/family crest for one thing. (Neither did Kate Middleton's family - they had to make one up for her). \n\nGeri has poshed up a bit since marrying the Formula 1 guy, and she gets ribbed for it.  David gets ribbed for his whole country look too. And frankly so did Kate b4 Meghan.  \n\nThe English do not like it when the people start thinking \"above their station\".  It's fine to go down though -- which is why Harry and William speak Estuary English acents (I believe that's what it's called), rather than Received Pronunciation.  Kate used to get so much crap for her accent especially since none of her family including Pippa have it.",

            "I am beginning to feel like cheating is no longer the litmus test for a terrible person. People make mistakes and can grow and change. That old adage of \"once a cheater always a cheater\" is not universally true. Some can be predisposed to cheating, but others it's very situational. Human's are not meant to be monogamous, that's more of a recent development thanks to religions.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I don't condone cheating, if you can't be monogamous you need to have an honest conversation with your partner about non-monogamy. If they aren't on board then it's cheating if you pursue it. So you have to make a decision about if you are capable of being monogamous or if you need to leave this person because your values do not align.\n\nAnd if you did cheat, for whatever reason, you need to come clean to your partner. It's that simple. Clean up your house, address the cheating, and address what it means for your relationship. You fucked up, you own that and fix it... or the relationship ends.\n\nEither way, it doesn't define your entire life. And I am tired of seeing so many internet social justice warriors trying to define an entire person based on a mistake from the past if they are obviously owning it and moving past it.\n\nHowever, after looking up this former alleged mistress. I haven't found any evidence that it's true. Only her claims. The Beckham's dismissal of those claims. She said they sexted... but I can't find anywhere those sexts were verified. The thing the tabloids are clinging on to now is Posh saying that that period of time was the hardest time of her life... which is true if he was cheating OR someone was making their lives a miserable hell by telling tabloids he was cheating.",

Kids who can afford to do activities like dance, fencing, theatre, etc. from a young age with the best instructors and equipment are far more likely to get scholarships down the line. These are foundational building blocks of future success, they don't randomly materialize during adolescence.\n\nYou're thinking about kids' day-to-day experiences. You're right that young kids don't really have a concept of how money impacts them, but kids who grow up wealthy have so many more unconscious advantages, to say nothing of being able to afford richer cultural experiences like traveling that aren't available to poor children and the advantages of things like healthy food and good insurance.",

            "Former F45 head office employee here. The franchise was revolutionary when it was launched and they had heads of sports stars (namely footy players) buy franchises and promote it. It was associated with the ultra pretty and ultra fit even though they pitched it for every fitness level... which honestly given the size of the classes and roving trainers , it really didn't suit the entry level gym goer. The owners are two Aussie's who started the whole thing..and they had an Aussie team when they began. Head office.... what a toxic environment that was.   \n  \nThey then began going global and branched out to other countries - inc UK and USA - that's where Wahlberg came in. I reckon at that stage the hype and gloss had started to wear off in Aus. Oversaturation of the market, wayyy too many F45 studios in close proximity which resulted in price wars and petty issues. The membership price point each week was high as well.. no surprise that franchise owners decided to start selling them off.",

            "Okay, real important shit:\n\nFrom a Marxist perspective, having expensive stuff doesn't imply that you are part of the working class or not, this is why the \"*communist with an iPhone*\" argument makes no sense to us. If her dad earned enough through his own work to buy an expensive car, he still working class regardless.\n\nNow, if his income came from the ownership of private property (means of production) and therefore the exploitation of other people's work, then we can say he was not part of the working class but part of the bourgeoisie class instead.\n\nBeing from the working class is not defined by what you own as personal property, but by the fact that you sell your work.\n\nFrom what I could gather, her father started as an electric engineer who later started his own company, making him a petite bourgeoisie, or someone who controls the means of production but still has to work on them. Which in the Marxist analysis is not the most urgent contradiction to be fought in capitalism.\n\nSo, that's a materialistic way to understand the situation. Having stuff, even expensive ones doesn't define one's class in a Marxist definition, since we don't use lower, middle, and upper class as valid definitions. You are ether proletariat, petite bourgeoisie or bourgeoisie!\n\nTherefore, if you want to become part of the socialist movement but think you don't belong because you got a PS5 or some other expensive thing, just ask yourself: \"D*id I fucking work to buy this shit?*\" and if so, there are no contradictions.",

            "The French Revolution was a bourgeois revolution like the American Revolution. The political actors, depending on what year it was, were mainly middle class and above.  There were even aristocrats.  The first goals of the Revolution were to throw off the vestiges of the Ancien Regime, which had allowed the country to basically come to the brink of bankruptcy, and to reform the nature of the governments involvement with the Catholic Church.  The revolution is better understood as monarchists/traditionalists/conservatives vs liberals.  There were various calls for liberal reforms to reduce wealth inequality, but there was no eat the rich campaign.  Later there were strands of proto-socialism, but nothing that was even remotely successful.   \n\n\nAround 30k people died in the terror, in which regime opponents or people accused of being regime opponents were killed.  The Terror followed the start of the War in the Vendee. That civil war, started by the aforementioned opponents of the revolution, would eventually see 250k people killed. It drove valuable resources away from more important things. Thus the government worried about fighting a second civil war in a different region and sought to round up its enemies. Not saying it's ok, but that's what happened.",

            "We, Marxists, don't make a moral distinction about types of work. Let's take an example of someone who most people agree is \"not really working\", a digital influencer.\n\nDoes this hypothetical person use their time and energy to produce something that society considers to be valuable? And does the only income that this person has come from this production? If so, the person is working class.\n\nNow, we can argue about the perceived value of work, and I can agree with you that a digital influencer, a soccer player, and a top-listed Hollywood star earns too much money, but all of those people are technically working class if their income comes only from their work.\n\nThis discussion, about how much people can earn from work, is a very complicated one, and there is not black and white solution. Of course, she had a very easy life that in no way can be compared with the lives of the great majority of working-class people, but the real question we should be asking is why she earned so much by doing what we can consider little while the rest of us earn shit for a lot of work.\n\nThe problem is that the perceived value of work in capitalism is always skewed into a logic of profit over practical value, and this is a contradiction by itself since profit doesn't necessarily translate to benefits to society, most of the time it goes the opposite way.\n\nBut now here is the kicker, she isn't the problem, sure, we can perceive it as unfair what she earns compared to us, but she is just the tip of the iceberg, the real problem is those who have private property and earn exclusively through its ownership, AKA billionaires, heirs, landlords, bankers, etc.\n\nThe deconstruction of capitalism within a socialist perspective is from top to bottom.",

            "There is a distinction in the UK though. They literally have a caste system. \n\nFor example, working class is DB’s parents.

Kate Middleton is middle class and her parents are millionaires and she went to the same high school as a literal prince, but she was still middle class. You can’t just jump to upper class in the UK by being rich, there’s a lot more than comes to it (by design).",

That person I referred to was just an example. I never made the claim that ALL barbers are wealthy. If I made that claim, I would be badly applying anecdotal evidence.  However, my point was that there is variety. He could easily be an outlier and it would still back up that variety exists within the larger population. \n\nYou can't claim every single person is rich or poor simply from a job title like that.

Obviously I can’t know exactly what you’re thinking but it’s safe to assume that you’re saying calling people “too thin” when they are eating and exercising naturally and regularly is indeed body shaming, and people are inaccurately diagnosing you w eating disorders because you are “too thin” and you’re like wtf do you mean too thin this is my body. \n\nObv this doesn’t apply to Victoria Beckham lmao but it just stands out to me sometimes when someone takes a comment the wrong way like that because like, what’s the point now?",

            "He was a CB that scored loads. Once got 18 in a season!",
            "You stole this comment from someone else",
            "I'm sure Giggs will regret that pass, Rooney obviously has a better shot and if Giggs shoots and misses we'd all be saying he should have passed, but I'm certain Giggs could get the ball in an open net from 40-45 yrds out",
            "Near the end of the match to bear in mind, Giggs was getting older and probably thought the pass to Rooney the better option.",
            "Yeah all very true. \n\nReminds me of Birmingham retiring his shirt after he went to Dortmund. Seemed absolutely absurd at the time, now you think… hmm, they might have been onto something! \n\nI really think with his age, ability and how quickly he improves and adapts to new challenges, he has the potential to be in the Ballon D’Or mix for a lot of his career, and probably isn’t far off it now to be honest. But let’s see how the next 5 years go for him.",
            "I mean one was saving Chelsea's season, while the other is elevating an already great Madrid team. Palmer's great, but it's apples and oranges.",
            "G/A isn't the end all be all of anything, neither is xG.\n\nWatch Cole Palmer play, watch Jude play.\n\nTell me it's even close.",
            "Foden’s special, no doubt about it and has had his most impactful season yet but it’s not about numbers. \n\nI just think Bellingham’s intelligence, ability and versatility is off the charts, and how fast he improves. He’s 20 and playing like that? It’s scary to think how good he could be when he’s 24.",
            "Love that interview",

            "Hahah",
            "Nice one, thanks\n\nIt's at 13 mins if anyone else is looking.",
            "I still think it matters. A volley should be reserved for something with no bounce on the ground after the previous touch. His finish against Newcastle was technically far more difficult and appealing than this, where the ball just sits up for him on the bounce.",
            "No it's way harder. Half volley is just as it's bouncing, it's on the way up usually and the margin for error is a lot bigger",
            "Im not sure I'd even fancy 11 Ronaldos against 11 Rooney's.\n\nRooney is one of the most complete footballers in the history of the game. Could have played that lad at Right Back and he'd have been MOTM",
            "Not saying it is, just replying to the point that aguero has more iconic moments which I don't think he does",
            "I rate a player on a comparison in terms of his\n\nBig match moments,\nNatural Talent,\nOverall attribute,\nExperience,\nTeamwork,\nTrophy,\nConsistency\n\nStats would be consider only after these.\nBecause some player create there on chance, some feeded by others.\nIn this case Rooney versitality in different positions+leadership+less resource(post-SAF era) he has created his own goals and assists. Also the amount of Screamer's he scored is unmatchable and always remembered.\n\nI'm not biased or anything. Still aguero dribbling, skills, goal ratio >> Rooney.\nBT aguero is nothing without kdb, d. Silva, yaya toure, zabaleta, nasri. BT this guy Rooney has better stats even with martial, depay, lingard, fellaini, smalling, Jones, Damian etc around him. Also remembering his midfielder role at Derby.",
            "The england generation has fallen short although they had very good defense and midfielders",
            "At his best Rooney was better than any of them though ; 09/10 I think he was giving Messi a run for his money in terms of scoring until the ankle injuries. All around play was fantastic as well of course.",
            "👌",
            "Worth reading the other articles on that site about his other books. Pretty funny!",
            "18??? wtf",
            "I've watched both play and both are great. Like I said, it's been half a season. Even Rashford had those when he looks like one of the best attackers in the world. Let Bellingham show consistency first.",
            "I guess you are right, did not take account of age there. To be fair though it is much harder to start in the City midfield, I would go as far as saying Bellingham would be on the bench for must win city games had he picked City. Not because he is bad - But because of how much time Pep takes to integrate players, and the presense of a certain Kevin De Bruyne.",
            "I think his point is that there’s lots of players who are just natural athletes who end up playing football but you could drop them into any sport or any event in the Olympics and they’d probably be good at it. \n\nI’m thinking of people like Pogba, CR7, apparently Phil Neville was an absolutely phenomenal all-round athlete as a kid and could have gone pro at cricket or distance running. \n\nRooney in the 400 metres or on a tennis court wouldn’t really fit.",
            "Hey bud you don't have to pretend that you get the joke, you can just smile and nod. Don't worry about it.",
            "Ok, what about this. You get a ball that has been absolutely pinged from right back. It bounces 10m away from you and is still traveling apace by the time you hit it. You hit it 30cm off the ground as it is coming down.\n\nIn that scenario there's not really anything different from if someone had just set you up with a \"pure\" volley from 10m away. Same technique, same speed at the point of contact, etc.\n\nOr, what if someone sets you up from 1m away with a nice lobbed pass that sits gently onto your foot. Technique-wise, no different from what Rooney did.",
            "Agree. I'm not comparing half volley to volley.",
            "When we lost 1-6 against Manchester City, half the team got disinterested, and he basically was playing Right Back. Well and Midfield and everywhere, never gave up.",
            "i said he has iconic moments too. Not gonna lie bro, a lot of those Ronney moments you listed arent iconic to any non united fan. Also, I said nothing wrong in my original comment, the fact its getting downvoted shows how dead football takes are on here",
            "I think any of them “on their day” were arguably the best player in the world. The difference between those players and Messi and Ronaldo is their output just wasn’t as consistent. \n\nWas Rooney on his day better than Robben or Sneijder on his day? I reckon it’s fair to put them in the same bracket.\n\nRooney’s 09/10 season was absolutely world class though i’ll give you that",
            "That's my point, Jude has been performing as one of the best at the club since he was at Dortmund. It hasn't been a short period but a few seasons. The only thing that's increased drastically is his goal scoring, but that's also come with a much more free role at Madrid.\n\nCole Palmer has been playing well for 6 months, and still not remotely close to the level of Jude.",
            "That’s less about their talents and more about what their bodies *look* like. Rooney is shorter and slightly stout, but he was quick, strong, explosive, and had great stamina and balance. He was an objectively great athlete in addition to being a sublime footballer, as were Pogba and cr7",
            "Damn you're super insecure. Calm down.",
            "No doubt some pure volleys will be easier to hit and less good looking than some bouncing balls. Roberto Carlos' strike against Tenerife is one of the best goals ever but it's not a volley, it's a bouncing ball. Maybe it's because I played tennis but I still stubbornly think it's useful to distinguish when describing the two types of strike.",
            "genuinely wondering if you've ever watched/played football before with the way youre discussing this issue. the situations you describe are completely different. any ball that bounces will have a much slower and more predictable trajectory than a pure volley",
            "My apologies!",
            "It’s a subjective opinion really, which would be heavily influenced on which team you support. There’s probably not a massive amount in it in terms of both players, but I’d personally say Rooney edges it because he’s won everything he could have at United.\n\nCredit to Aguero though for adapting his game to become a “Pep” player, I think there was a chance his city career could have ended sooner but he made himself indispensable.",
            "If you look at Sneijder's career his peak was very short, it's basically 2 good seasons. He was struggling at Real at the age of 25, spent 3 years at Inter and then moved to Galatasary. His 09-10 was incredible but it's hard to argue that wasn't a bit of a purple patch in a career otherwise blighted by underperformance and injury.\n\nGiven you were making a point about consistency, I think it's unfair to group Sneijder with two players who actually were consistently world class and at the top of the game for 10 years.",
            "Sancho was performing at world class levels for multiple seasons at Dortmund too. Look where he is now.",
            "I do understand where you're coming from. There are different angles to look at the classification.",
            "I feel like it’s useful for helping a player or expert explain and practice these techniques, but in colloquial speech it just becomes unneccesarilly complicated",
            "What if someone sets you up with a volley from right next to you? That's as slow and predictable as it gets.",
            "I get where you’re coming from, although my main point was that none of them were consistently good enough to be in that top tier so Sneijder kind of typifies my point more than any other! \n\nMy main point was that “on their day” any of them is as good as the other. Do agree that Sneijder had the worst career of the 3 mentioned though, but the reason for including him was the 09/10 season where he arguably should’ve won the ballon d’or.",
            "Yep, which means you're world class until you're not. And currently Jude is and has been world class with more than a 6 month sample size.\n\nSteven Gerrard was world class until he played for the Galaxy, does that change what he did before he dropped off?\n\nNot really sure how that's relevant.",
            "That's exactly what I'm saying as well. 6 months of good football doesn't make you world class. Jude has potential to get there and will in all probability get there. Cole Palmer can get there too, you can't deny that either. But he hasn't done enough to be top 3 of all time like the original comment said."

And that’s not what i’m saying so let’s not get it twisted. idk them personally, and I definitely don’t know what their situation was like at the time (and i’m not speculating on how it was or is). But to think that most celebrities who are married are monogamous and live happily ever after is just not realistic. I think a lot of them have an agreement - “Just dont make me look stupid” (beyond the blinds) which makes sense. You do you sometimes, I do me, sometimes let’s bring it together lol. I think to be that kinda high profile you have to be very secure and independent in a lot of ways (not always ofc). You are constantly surrounded by some of the most attractive, successful, wealthy, possibly intelligent lol people. You have access to pretty much everything and everyone. The way the public reacted to Will and Jada saying they were Open is probably why a lot of celebrities stay quiet - because “we don’t understand”, it’s not a “normal” thing for us “normal” people to do but their job is kinda to not be?  Do I think ALL celebrities who are married have an arrangement?? no of course not, i’m sure there are tons who are happily monogamous! But I do think it’s more common than we think.",

I was so impressed by that in their documentary and he was at the height of his career. It’s just such a different life. I wouldn’t  want a marriage like that but clearly some of these famous couples make it work. Also it’s crazy they survived the insane media storm and hatred both of them received from crazy soccer fans when David lost that big match and they blamed Victoria. Plus the cheating scandal. I would have bounced so quickly bc it’s not like Victoria wasn’t rich and famous on her own.  They clearly love each other enough to stay together 25 years through all the bullshit and British tabloid culture plus intense English soccer fandom. And have figured out how to make it work bc 25 years is kind of crazy for famous people and they seem to really love their kids as well",

Marriage already is a compromise, and everyday couples go through so much shit , having that amplified by 100 and having your entire relationship constantly under a microscope and up for discussion by the public who knows absolutely nothing about them except the things they want us to know…….. hell ya i’m sure that shit is HARD!

Again I'm not defending him, personally I think it highly likely that he did at least something he shouldn't, especially with Loos. I'm just calling attention to the rather dodgy way it was handled by the press\n\nEdit to add: If anything it's the impression that Victoria is just happy for him to do what he likes behind her back that I object to. They seem to have a pretty healthy relationship and it's not like she married him for his money. She was called Posh Spice for a reason.",

            "Seems that a key aspect of avoiding that type of man, is to question early on: is he moving heaven and earth *only* bc it fulfills his needs/desires, or for you as a person as well? After being with my partner for 4 years, I finally realized that he is invested and supportive of our relationship *as long as it’s benefiting him*. This is different than actually prioritizing me and our relationship. There’s an underlying selfishness/self centered-ness that is the key difference here. Is he truly looking out for you, or is he making you happy bc of what you bring to his life and so it benefits him and he enjoys it?  The only sign of this I can think of early on in a relationship is if he’s empathetic or not. If he’s moving the world to make you happy, but you see that he’s not actually empathetic in general, then that’s for him not you.",
            "Honestly, it’s been a theme in every relationship I’ve ever had.\n\nThey will do whatever it takes to obtain you. To make you feel like you’re the only one they’ll ever want. They will make you believe they are so in love with you.\nThey will make all of these promises for the future and deliver on none. \n\nBecause once they have you, your undivided attention, admiration, support, and love… that’s when they start to reveal their real selves. \n\nThen you get the bare minimum, if you’re even lucky enough to get that. Then they see you as if you’re a threat to their autonomy. Then many of them monkey branch to their next prospect, or they just cheat. \n\nEither way, wasting our lives on this process is more often than not fruitless. Because the delivery rate of their promises is likely below 10% at best.",

            "I’ve never been pursued by a man like that so I could be completely wrong. But my take on it is when a man really goes over the top like that to win a woman over at the beginning of a relationship, he’s doing all of this for his OWN wants and desires, not hers. \n\nAt least more often than not, a man isn’t thinking “this woman is so amazing, I just want to make her feel happy and loved” and more often it’s “I’ve gotta bag this chick cause I want her for myself, so I’ll do everything I can to keep her.”\n\nThe men approaching relationships with that attitude are the ones who cheat 5-10 years down the road when they start seeing her as an actual human and not just an object of his desire.",
            "The “bait and switch” men are forever bitching about is nothing but projection.

Maybe *they* can, but most of *us* sure as fuck can’t.

She was called cold and callous and mean and frigid for years and he never really stood up for her.\n\nWomen hate when I say this, but it really is a symptom of society. Men are for the most part raised to turn to sex when they’re upset or need another outlet to express emotion. I think as women we have to be incredibly diligent when finding partners, because if you choose the wrong one, they will more than likely disappoint you.",
            "Your feelings are totally valid. I finished the doc too and it seems like he really loves her and his kids. But then the doc is painted in a way to make us have a lot of sympathy for him because of how nasty his coaches and fans were when he wasn’t “perfect”. \n\nI like that he seemed honest saying he’s not a smart man and school would never be his thing. He seems to run on reacting to things in his sport and emotions for how he needs to feel support. \n\nI did feel terrible for Victoria giving birth alone the 3rd time. I can imagine no matter who you’re married to that’s pretty unforgivable. Anyone can die during child birth even with a c section. \n\nAnd did you notice their 4th kid his daughter’s birth wasn’t mentioned at all? That was weird. \n\nI’m kind of shocked how it’s portrayed that Victoria spent most of her time with the kids and taking care of the kids because she has several businesses and they weren’t mentioned at all. They both seemed very busy but of course David’s career came first. \n\nI don’t know how to feel about people who see someone on tv and then say that’s the one for me. It’s a bit like picking out a trophy as a goal right? \n\nHow deep was his affair? Do they have an open marriage? I don’t know. \n\nI think another big issue is having a relationship with anyone who has the upper hand in a marriage where their career trumps everything. Having so much power and access to anyone you want where cheating is easy or acceptable. These are not normal situations and not going to be emotionally healthy either. \n\nMaybe he justifies it as he had his career and he gave her children or he had his career and got to have the family he wanted while being hands off. \n\nHis kids seem to have issues too and maybe they don’t hold them to a high standard. He probably is much more lax than his father was because he’s the male star of the family right. The doc barely mentioned anything about their struggles now.",
            "Pretty typical if you've ever been married. The amount of effort you put in for a man who is head over heels in love matches the attempt to woo you. You think this is it, this is *your* person, you're a team. You happily cook for them, have their babies, put in effort to clean and remember the calendar and manage the home.\n\nThen the wooing gradually stops, leaving you with the work, which was \"never a problem before\". Now that everything is taken care of (by you) they are free to discover themselves, have fun, play golf, have kids-free nights etc while you hold down the homestead. You become boring and serious and not *fun* like you were when you met (because you're tired and overworked). Then they have an affair to feel like someone is \"paying attention\" to them again, to feel that spark with someone.\n\nDita von Teese was cheated on. Beyonce was cheated on. Jennifer Aniston, Halle Berry, Eva Longoria, Gwen Stefani. Marriage to a man does nothing for women except tax breaks and medical privileges. You will never be hot enough, talented enough, famous enough, beautiful enough to keep them loyal if they don't want to be. Vows certainly won't change that. And many don't want to be loyal, they simply want a reason to blame you for it so they can have you take care of every day labor, get their dick wet *and* not have to feel guilty.",

            "I'd imagine that one of the shittiest things about being Beyonce or Posh Spice is that the only men approaching your level of success, and who are therefore confident enough to approach you and suitable as partners, got there by being fanatically dedicated to their jobs and possessing narcissistic tendencies.\n\nNarcissistic workaholics can be middle class too, but you've got a much better chance of meeting and falling in love with a decent man who's going to value you beyond the honeymoon phase than they do.",
            "It’s called love bombing. I’m sure he was the same way with every woman he cheated on Victoria with. It’s not normal and it’s characteristic of a narcissist.",
            "No. My husband only gets more thoughtful and doting as we age. You just need to find a partner who knows love and attraction aren't enough, the same way loving flowers isn't enough to maintain a garden. The appreciation, gifts, over the top genstures, etc are *for the person giving them*. It's a thrill to be high on another person like that. You feel like they are The Answer. And that's all it is. Unless it's translated into enduring respect and team building, it's not at all enough for a relationship to coast on long term. \n\nLove is choosing to do the work to grow, hold yourself accountable, be candid about your needs (and when they're not met) and develope the skills to maintain the relationship. It doesn't just happen. You choose to be the best possible version of yourself and support each other in the endeavor. Don't settle for less.",
            "I know good men who respect their partners in healthy, loving relationships over the looong term. but I also think there are certain types of kindness / “kindness” that are more likely to correlate with men who are less dedicated or who are faking being nice (like insisting that a woman “doesn’t have to” work….while totally not respecting when a woman WANTS to work so the man doesn’t “get to” do the “nice thing” of supporting her financially aka holding all the power). So there are good men but there are a LOT of things in our culture that help disguise dangerous men as good men. The older I get, the more examples I gather of what to avoid. \n\nBut women really do need have healthy boundaries from the beginning to avoid getting enmeshed with someone who won’t respect her worth and boundaries later on. I personally struggle with setting and enforcing healthy boundaries, ESPECIALLY with men because I got so used to changing mysef so male partners wouldn’t leave me. so I genuinely don’t think it’s safe for me to keep dating men because that puts me in a situation where I can’t trust the man OR myself to not put me in harm’s way. Thankfully God made me bisexual so I can go look for a wife but I also learned how to live happily on my own.",
            "No, this is what life would be like if you choose to get married to a celebrity. \n\nI’ve worked in the talent space for a number of years and famous people mostly don’t get famous by accident. They’re extremely driven, self-centered, focused on their careers, and have big egos that need lots of stroking. That doesn’t mean they can’t also be nice and respectful people, and many of them are, but a pathological need to be liked combined with extreme attractiveness and wealth means that a lot of opportunities to be unfaithful come up and there’s a lot of psychological need that those offers fulfill. There are people like this who are not famous, or even incredibly attractive or wealthy too— my ex was someone who needed an incredible amount of external validation and that was a big part of why he cheated. \n\nWhile I hesitate to say that my husband would never, because never is a long time, I think I would have to get to a place of extreme neglect in my relationship in order to even create conditions in which he would consider it. Not because I am so special or because he’s so great but because cheating goes against his conception of self— it would make him feel worse about himself, not better. That kind of obsessive love that David offered Victoria at the beginning burns out hot and fast and after that is when you find out who you’re really with. Do your best to figure out whether the person you’re committing to has values and priorities that run much deeper than however they feel about you in the current moment.",
            "It’s likely related to the class differential in their relationship. He’s working-class, whereas she grew up well-off. Husbands deal with their feelings of inferiority towards their wives by cheating on them. A lot of men need to feel superior and like they’re in control. Same applies to husbands who earn less than their wives. Crazy Rich Asians shows this very well.",
            "I think if you've been married before then you should know that at the end of the day it doesn't matter if you're Posh Spice or whatever.

            "It seems unlikely that most people pick up and move to other countries or have photo shoots with Beyoncé.\n\nIn a failed attempt to have a discussion with an incel, he kept going on about how women are attracted to money and power, and it's the hyper-successful men who do well with women.  And maybe lots of women are attracted to money and power, but the richest men I could think of - Bill Gates, Elon Musk, and Jeff Bezos - are all divorced.\n\nI tried to explain that I look at someone who obsesses so much about money and careers as a bad partner, because you only get so many hours in a week and I need a man who will spend a lot of them with his wife and children, not trying to add another zero to his net worth.  You need enough money to live and prepare for emergencies and retire, but beyond that being super successful usually means sacrificing your life for your career.\n\nWhen the belt in our vacuum cleaner broke, my Dad took me and my sister to the store to get a new one, and let us help him take it apart and get the old belt out and put the new one in, and explained what all the parts inside were.  I'm sure that someone like David Beckham, with all his millions, would just throw it out and get a new one, or even just has a maid or something and doesn't even vacuum his own house.\n\nI want a husband who will show the kids the inside of the vacuum cleaner and let them help take it apart and put it back together, not be at the office (or the stadium) making another million dollars.",
            "Part of the not getting comfortable is really being willing to boot them if they drop their side of the bargain. \n\nI love my partner - and I behave lovingly, because love is a VERB, not a feeling - but he knows, deep in his soul, that I will kick him out if he starts slacking without a good reason.  If he's sick or having some sort of issue, OK, no problem, I will pick up the slack.  But if he's lazy or starts letting things go because he's not taking care of his mental health, I can and have kicked him out.   Love doesn't mean you enable bullshit.   \n\nTo his credit, he strove to do better and has improved a lot and it hasn't been an issue for several years (he did majority of parenting for a while there, and we switch household and kids back and forth as our jobs picked up and ebbed).

            "Marriage is hard. We join a partnership and then have individual desires and goals. We never stop growing, and it is a constant balance of individualism and collectivism.

            "No, my husband left his very very profitable career in Germany and a job offer in the UK because I didn’t liked living in neither place and I didn’t wanted to mother in another country in a foreign language. I remember he said to me “it’s okay, I’m smart I will be able to do it anywhere, I just want you to be happy” he just got more doting as we aged and as our family grew.

            "I think it's important to distinguish between \"will move the heavens and earth *for you*\" and \"will move the heavens and earth *for themselves* to have a chance to enjoy you.\" Those can appear very similar in the early stages of a relationship, but the second one is actually a product of someone enjoying the experience of limerence and the novelty of a new relationship. *Nobody* can maintain that state of novelty forever. And someone's willingness to sacrifice things to be around you in that circumstance is no more indicative of their long-term behavior than someone staying up all night playing on a new video game system is proof that they will never buy another.\n\nUltra-intense infatuation at the start of a relationship is a bit of a pinkish flag in my experience. Someone who is overwhelmed with thunderclap, throw-my-life-away-immediately feelings for you when they barely know you is susceptible to that with other people as well. His willingness to risk his million-dollar job and endanger the livelihood of his teammates and disappoint his fans in order to spend more time with her was more an indicator of his devotion to his own gratification than his devotion to her as a person at that early stage.\n\nI also don't think Beckham is a bad person- they were pretty young when they got married and they seem to have made a pretty good go of it all these years later. People can mature, and change. But I don't think looking at the most successful, attractive, generally desired people in the world and seeing that they get cheated on should make one despair. Because someone else's fidelity is not about whether or not you are able to forever remain objectively the hottest person in the room (you can't, nobody can) but based on their character. There are \"mere mortals\" out there in happy, faithful long-term relationships, and A-list stars and supermodels who get stepped out on.

I’ve been cheated on in the past and so has my husband. And as someone who’s been cheated on: it hurts, but it also hurts when someone just blindsides me with a breakup without cheating. Both of those situations involve me realizing my partner had one foot out the door well before I was aware of it. The difference is that I trust my husband not to cheat on me. And I don’t have a magical formula for knowing which men will or won’t cheat, but I think refusing any level of disrespect within a relationship is a pretty safe bet. \n\n\nVictoria and Beyoncé didn’t get cheated on because they weren’t good enough, David and Jay Z cheated because they’re cheaters.",

            ">  is this what life will be like if you choose to get married to a man? \n\nThis isn't gender-specific. In the beginning of relationships, both people are really into each other and do things for each other.\n\nThat's, perhaps, not sustainable. And it's dangerous to put it in gender terms, and of course, we have male/male, female/male, and female/female relationships, so we shouldn't assume that this is just a problem with men, it's gender-blind.\n\nThe issue is, when the excitement wears off, does the relationship get better/stronger, or weaker/worse? In their case, the latter. Very common. It happens. It's really unhealthy though to assume that women are the passive recipients of men's initial, perhaps unhealthy, obsession.",
            "This will probably be a hot take/unpopular opinion. (Skip to the end for said take)\n\nNo. That is absolutely not what it is like to marry a man. I’ve been married 25 years.

I don't think it's responsible and more importantly fair to ones self to read into anything more than could possibly be known. While he may have made decisions without her input to go play football in a different country, they both learned right out of the gate of the crazy circumstances that come with celebrity lifestyle. The very lifestyle they both had chosen even if at first they didn't understand it fully.\n\nEveryone also has to take into consideration that the Beckham special, like the Arnold one and all the others before, are put together in a way to be very interesting, captivating and highly marketable. It's entertainment, while it can capture a good deal, it's edited together, like a great movie. \n\nMy take away - 2 extremely popular celebrities met 25 years ago. They had strong family values and shared a genuine connection and desire to be with one another. Despite ever escalating challenges they bore the weight, they stayed connected and fought to make it work, both of them at different times in different ways. They raised 4 seemly level headed kids despite all the craziness. Most of all, they seem not just to still love one another, but to still be in love with each other. \n\nYou never know how people truly are, I never thought what kind of people they may be. But they both seem genuine, down to earth and kind hearted despite having a combined net worth of 1/2 billion dollars and living through so much publicly created drama. Also, like many marriages I know of, she's the stronger of the two, she's the glue which he's very aware of...",
            "It can go the other way too. My best friend (who is a guy) got cheated on by his wife of 13 years (they have 4 kids together). She wasnt terribly good looking, but she lost a lot of weight after a lap band procedure and started going out all the time. Cheated with 2 different men. He hired a private investigator because she wouldn't be honest, then asked for a divorce. She moved out. When someone has a boost of self esteem and confidence they didnt have previously, they cheat. I have seen 2 other women get gastric surgery and do the exact same thing. My friend let her sleep in and did the school runs, packed the kids lunches, mostly made dinner etc, so it wasn't that she felt underappreciated, she barely did anything. He was far more a hands on father than she was a mother. They owned a business together and he did 75% of the work too. She, I also believe, married him for his family wealth and social status and once that novelty wore off, she looked elsewhere. She, I believe, took his niceness for granted and wanted a \"real man\" ultimately, based on standard social norms and conventions. She openly told everyone he was gay as to why they were divorcing because his actions in their marriage were considered not manly enough to the greater society. It made me sad that we are still dealing with these tropes, even amongst lay people (he isn't ridiculously rich btw, just his family has had a business for a few generations).",

My husband has been nothing but ABSOLUTE support and stability. We have 2 kids. At the time they were both pretty young and post-op I was out of commission (literally asleep for 2 months), he took the full brunt of the work. And not a single complaint. \n\nWhat's left of the tumor is inoperable and will slowly kill me. When I found out..I was in pieces, and as I sat at rock bottom, he sat with me and cried.\n\nThen he stood up to carry what was left of me until I was ready to piece myself back together. \n\nMy husband is my best friend and my rock. \n\nAlot of men are literal trash. But not all of them. There are some really amazing dudes out there. I'm sorry I took one off the market. But. Im selfish, he's amazing, and he's mine. Lol",
            " That’s my husband. We’ve been together for seven years and we are inseparable. We are best friends, we adore each other. You know when you have those friends who can just give you a look and you both know what you’re saying and burst into laughter? It’s like that. But we live and work together. We are raising two kids together. He is nothing but supportive. He tells me if he disagrees with something, but it’s always rooted in respect. We disagree (of course, everyone does sometimes!!) but it is always a discussion and then we end up laughing about something. \n\nI never worry (or even think) about him cheating. Not because I don’t think he finds other people attractive, but because he respects me as a person.\n\nI honestly wish everyone could be as happy as I am with my husband. We met on Tinder and I liked him so much after our first date. We got locked out of my apartment on our second date and he offered for me to go back to his and he would sleep on the couch.\n\nNo sleep was had.\n\nBut we have been inseparable ever since. He makes me happier than anyone ever has. He is stable, cheery, hot, nice, sexy, funny, smart… I pinch myself because I just can’t believe he picked me!!

He needs more time” idealists…Then the broken promises start to stack up. Eventually you just give up. After we broke up and I started going to therapy, I could see everything without the rose glasses and I understood what I felt was deep grief for my time and my younger self. How could I do that to myself?

It became like that treatment was a reward he wanted to “withhold.” That shitshow lasted 5 months before I found he was *married* and bounced.\n\nIn my current relationship, most of our first dates were *fun* but reasonable.

It was all over the place when Billy Joel divorced Christie Brinkley, like “If Christie Brinkley isn’t safe from it, none of us are.” It just feels like weird internalized sexism where we’re implying that in a perfect world, being mega beautiful is enough to sustain a relationship, and that men should be satisfied in a relationship because their partner is super hot.\n\nIt’s like… maybe Christie Brinkley is a terrible partner. Maybe [insert super hot, super successful actress] always put her career ahead of her spouse.

            "I’ve seen a lot of women comment about how women need to start mirroring men: prioritizing themselves and their wants the same way men do, and “centering” themselves in relationships from the get-go. Like start asking men “what are *you* doing for me NOW”, and drop him if he can’t reciprocate what you’re willing to put in.\n\nWomen should do this regardless of if they want a casual hookup, a boyfriend, or a husband. If a man can’t or won’t “do” anything for you that doesn’t suit his own needs/desires at the same time, he’s eventually going to be a burden that will sap your time and energy.",

            "I agree with your points, but I do think there’s a trend *of something* going on here. \n\nIMO a lot of it’s because of the differences in male vs female socialization. Like I think too many men are socialized to be less emotionally equipped to deal with the “excitement wearing off” and/or more likely to still expect women to support them or pick up the slack regardless of what they reciprocate with. In part because too many women are socialized to go all in and support others (especially men) and are blindsided when that’s not reciprocated in relationships as it should be.\n\nI also think too many men have a problem idealizing women, perhaps due to being so starved for any other emotionally intimate relationship except with the woman they sleep with/date/marry. And idealization is just a form of “positive” dehumanization.

Maybe that'll change as we get into our 60s, but right now everyone is just plugging away.\n\nI was around when most of these relationships started. There was no outlandish excitement. There was no \"love bombing\" (AFAIK) it was all pretty pragmatic. The way it's described here sounds like a mental illness, e.g., [bipolar](https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/2010/05/major-ups-downs). Not literally, but the extreme, unhealthy ups and downs. \n\nNot ironically, all I've ever really wanted in a partner is an even keel. Relationships are partnerships, marriage is literally a contract. You need an effective partnership, like any business. Of course you need love and affection, but it should be like forming a partnership for a business. Are these two people going to be able to run this business effectively? It's not dehumanizing to look at the fundamentals in a non-romantic/non-emotional way.\n\nAnyhoo, to that point, some of these marriages started with online dating, always initiated by the woman. They all treated it like a job. They'd have 4-5 lunch dates per week. It was a numbers game. \n\nI just wonder who is socializing people this way, and how it's happening. I've just never seen it.

Women are most likely to be raped or murdered by the men they’re in relationships with. The *number one cause* of death in the US for pregnant women is murder by their male intimate partner. \n\nJust look at the rates of unequal division of domestic labor and childcare in even “egalitarian” marriages, when both partners work full time jobs and even when the women is *the breadwinner*. The number one reason given by women in divorce is “trouble with traditional roles/lack of support”. \n\nJust look at the cultural and political backlash due to women’s emancipation from the home/traditional marriage and unequal dating/courting dynamics. Politicians are successfully repealing reproductive rights and criminalizing abortion left and right. They’re going after birth control and no-fault divorce next. Dangerous and misleading patriarchal propaganda for “ideal marriages” and reductive gender roles, from the tradwife movement to the manosphere, is *rampant*.\n\nJust look at the rates of men turning to *misogyny and male supremacy* as a result of not getting laid or struggling with dating. Women that have these *same issues* are not advocating mass rape or forced marriages, mass enslavement or repealing of rights, or mass violence or murder of men, so *what the fuck is going on with men?*\n\nLike, incels are literally considered one of the most dangerous domestic terrorist groups on the rise by organizations like the Southern Poverty Law Center and the National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism.

            "Tl:dr: there’s a whole field of study called “primate ethology” that dissects different kinds of social groups that primates practice. “Monogamy” or pair bonding works very differently, in primates. Ethology has identified “rules” that primate groups follow, from how social behaviors, over generations, affect body size, testes size, etc. There’s good reason to suggest that, no, humans actually aren’t “naturally monogamous”. (Edit: put this at the top). \n\nI think we should separate out the emotional and sexual aspects of monogamy here, and put it to one side. That’s not what @literaryqueenxx is addressing, if I’m following them correctly (and I’m pretty sure I am). I think they were talking about social monogamy, or the social pressures to pair bond for life. \n\nThey’ve got a point! If you look at primates, pair bonding (which is rare, and only some species of primates do it) is all about reciprocity. It happens in species where the female is pretty secure, has her own hunting territory, etc. The male can share her space and help her patrol her territory and find food, and when they mate and make babies, their reproductive success (i.e., whether that baby makes it to reproductive age) is tied to the other partner’s success. So both work hard to ensure that the other is okay, and the pair are closely bonded w each other. They spend hours grooming each other, for ex; Titi monkeys sitting with their tails intertwined for ages, etc. Males are generally not much bigger than females, and it’s really hard to tell them apart from size, because there isn’t a lot of competition between males. Edit: pair bonds are *not* 100% sexually monogamous: both sneak off and cheat, but they come back. \n\nOther species of primates have completely different sexual practices. The shape that their social groups take depends first on exogamy: who leaves the natal group at puberty? For ones where the females stay in the natal group after puberty (and the males leave to find partners), those females maintain exceptionally close bonds with their matriline, and raise the babies together. Males then compete with other males for access to those females, so the males get bigger. You’ll see this misunderstood in popular culture as males being “dominant” over females. That’s not what’s happening. The males are fighting other males, and they get bigger when they have to compete - so size is related to competition *with other males*, not because being big and strong makes them able to overtake females. Females still have lots of agency: If the females don’t like the dude, the entire matriline leaves. \n\nThere are other social groups, where males that stay after puberty (and females leave); those groups are promiscuous polygamous. They include chimpanzees and bonobos, which we’re more closely related to. \n\nThere’s ways to detect what kind of sex and social groups primates have from their bodies, because what they do has consequences for natural selection. There’s consequences for overall body size, and also something called “sperm competition”, a hypothesis that proposes a link between the size of testes and social group. Bla bla bla, there are consequences on the body. I’m not going to give a full overview of primate ethology here because it will take awhile to explain, and I think I’ve already lost most people, haha. \n\nAnyways, if you look at human bodies, and apply these rules, we don’t look “naturally monogamous”. Rather, it’s a social belief of many human cultures (not all). \n\nSo separate out emotional and sexual preferences (which are culturally mediated anyway) with social monogamy, which works very differently, in reality, in the primate world. We’ve lived in societies which, because of inheritance laws, very much promote the view that women are property, and their mating is to be guarded carefully. Our societies have followed suit, from the underlying economic and political systems that we’ve made up around this premise. \n\nHumans have our own 5-6 million years of evolutionary history, so it’s not a hard and fast rule that this can be applied to humans - but when we do apply the “rules” from ethology, and look at our own bodies, we’re left with the suggestion that actually, no- we may *not* have been very monogamous for much of that history. \n\nI am very much a serial monogamist, and I love that I am - but let’s be careful to acknowledge that culture very much promotes “acceptable” sexual behavior, and often does so not because it’s good for us, but because it perpetuates the social order, and underlying economic systems. \n\nEdit: moved tldr up, and tried to cut this down a bit…",

            "I don't know what you mean by \"parsing semantics\". I suppose you're saying that I am misunderstanding the intended nature of this sub - that may be true. It has certainly changed from a much less radical place and maybe it has indeed become more of a women only sub. Interestingly, a couple months ago a woman was writing a very gentle and thoughtful comment here on this exact matter and she was also attacked (not as being in the wrong sub, but as being brainwashed and betraying her gender and whatnot) and her comment was removed.\n\n>Perhaps you’d understand that not all bears are a threat, but I’m certainly going to be cautious around one because you can’t tell immediately which are dangerous and which aren’t.\n\nAt no point was I arguing that women shouldn't be cautious around men. Or that they shouldn't expect every man that they don't know well to be dangerous and have bad intentions. *Of course* it's rampant enough for that. And of course it's systematic and ingrained in society.\n\nBut if \"most everyone knows it's not ALL\", then why insist on phrasing it like it was, when that's clearly offensive to those that you claim not to be talking about? Replace 'men' with any of the other demographic category and the problem is immediately clear. The bear analogy illustrates another issue - bears are a threat because they are bears, not because many individual bears are bad actors that shed a bad light on bears as a group. It's being a bear that makes them dangerous, it's their nature. No bear attacking a human does so because it's evil (probably). But every man that abuses a woman is an individual that chooses to do so knowing what they're doing is awful. It's not man's nature. Focusing on the sex is just taking away responsibility from every bad actor and dumping it on every good one.\n\nMaking a generic statement that concludes an attribute (\"doesn't speak with words\") from a category (\"male\") is always wrong and offensive. If the category is race it's racism and if it's sex it's sexism. But somehow the world being sexist towards women justifies (women) being sexist towards men. And if someone takes offense or points this out they are just part of the problem and toxic. Gender or sex just shouldn't matter at all for things that aren't related to them like how much somebody earns, what their opinion is worth or how they are treated.\n\nI don't know why I even put in this effort. Conversations in other subs sometimes end in the other person (or myself) agreeing that they were wrong when arguments have been exchanged, but not here. It probably really isn't worth it. The most depressing thing about this whole conversation is that people will always feel justified in what they're doing, even if it's *the exact thing* they are trying to fight.",
            "i only have one TV and it’s in my living room so the daybed makes movie nights and general lounging more comfortable for me as my apartment is a little too small for a sectional or larger type of couch. also it was more affordable (about $400 all in) while still being stylish! \n\nalso would be better for cuddling for the next time i’m ready for a male friend!",
            "It's fine to think \"heterosexual marriages are statistically bad for women so I simply won't get married\", but it's dangerous to think \"all heterosexual marriages are bad so I may as well stay in mine\", and I think some people definitely use that reasoning to justify staying in their bad relationships. FWIW, my dad retired early to stay home and be my brother's primary parent to support my mom's career too.\n\nIf women don't leave their shitty male partners, then those men have no incentive to ever change because they already get everything they want without putting in any effort. They get the benefits of being in a relationship, plus so much more, because men in equal partnerships aren't also getting an unpaid maid, household manager, and sex worker who only provides pleasure without getting any in return. (There's a reason sex work is work and must be compensated properly.) I get that it can be extremely difficult to leave when kids are involved, but if your husband is basically another child you need to take care of, then you're going to be better off without him anyway. Being a single mom to 3 kids is hard, but being a single mom to 3+1 kids is harder, especially if that last one is uneducable.\n\nI'm not saying it's women's fault that men are shitty, but rather, if you will absolutely not consider leaving no matter how bad the relationship gets, then there's no advice anyone can give you to improve things. If he's so shitty that he doesn't care that he's making you miserable, then no amount of additional misery will change his mind. I see this a lot on reddit - \"My partner is terrible in all these ways but I don't want to break up. How can I get him to change?\" The answer is, you can't. If he's not already doing it after seeing you in misery, he never will. People complain that redditors always tell advice seekers to break up, but if someone is sucking all the happiness out of your life and has no desire to change then what's left to do? It's not fair or right that he's doing this to you, but if he won't change then you're the one who must. If you won't break up, then at least end the status quo. Stop having sex with someone who doesn't care about your pleasures, stop cooking for someone who will never cook for you, stop cleaning up after the man child. Do the bare minimum you need to survive - do your own laundry, cook your own food, pay your own bills, and that's it. If he doesn't care about your happiness, you at least have to.",

It's the wrong place and time to say that not everyone is monogamous. This is a thread about a woman who is monogamous and assumed their partner was as well.\n\nI put my disclaimer at the top because reading through these threads I've been tempted to add a comment saying... \"not all men\". But then I remind myself wrong place, wrong time.\n\nAnd as much as I would like to say not all men think of cheating, I was recently having, what are appearing to be the same generic, \"lonely\" thoughts as other men, and I talked to my wife about them.\n\nNot all women have access to the, \"but actually...\" option.",

And those logical explanations, if you consider yourself a rational agent, should consequentially inform how you feel about other people in a general and individual manner.",

Owen wasn't bought so much because he was needed as because he was the biggest name they could afford/get that season.\n\nReal Madrid between at the end of Perez's tenure became a mess on account of the promise to sign a new star every season. New star player meant he sold \"boring\" players to make room for them; most notably Makelele.",

I don't care what anyone says, I'm sure people these days would say Scholes was better than Beckham. But they won the CL final against Bayern without Keane or Scholes, that's how good Beckham was.",

As an example, say I have a house of a million, paid off the mortgage by 90% , yet have only 1000 on the bank.\n\nNow I want to get 100000 moneys. \n\nI could either liquidate the asset hidden in the mortgage agreement by re-mortgaging or selling the house. I could also take out a loan.\n\nTaking our that loan accounts for 0.0 on your networth. Hence, it doesn't really matter when your assets are liquid or non-liquid., *In fact having the assets in investments is preferable to having it as cash-on-hand or a spending account*.\n\nIt sounds like you think having the cash is better.

Would it be worth suing over? Possibly in the small claims court (in the uk where I’m based) but if I need to get a lawyer then probably not as their fixed fees would easily eat into it. At $8.5m - yes they will charge a premium for their services but you would assume the proportion would be lower; assuming he wins.\n3) my point was still mainly around liquid investment vs fixed assets or assets that he isn’t expected to realise anytime soon. Included in that “net worth” will be his properties, certain “David Beckham” brands and his involvement in Inter Miami. A lot of these aren’t easily realisable so if an investment that had an expected investment time horizon of say 5 years, went completely bust; I still think it’s something to be sad about.",

You never know, she was definitely successful before, can’t take that away from her, this is just my own personal opinion, but I just think that marrying an extremely successful footie player didn’t hurt her finances/status, but we’ll never know! 🤷🏽‍♀️)",
            "I like that you said “they genuinely like each other” because I’ve forgiven my bf for things I wasn’t sure I wanted to forgive (he’s just neglectful from time to time, for example forgetting my birthday one year…) simply because we enjoy each others company so much and have so much chemistry. It would take something big for me to really be done with him. We’ve been together nearly 8 years now so we’ve had our rough patches, mostly those couple of months that pop up every once in a while where you bicker over everything. But when you just really enjoy living life with someone, you’re more willing to work on things. Especially if they’re a good partner overall and they just have their moments.\n\nI would never forgive cheating, though. That’s a personal dealbreaker for me. It would just completely change the way I saw everything. I already struggle with trusting people so much. Weirdly enough I still understand Victoria not wanting to leave - if she truly loves his company, they have a family together, plus all that $$$…  again, I wouldn’t stay but I can wrap my head around it.",

            ">A LOT of footballers seemingly have cheated on their wives & girlfriends!\n\nIdk it's also really common for musicians to cheat on their spouses but something tells me if she had cheated on David Beckham, the world would never let her live it down. Look how people turn on Sophia Bush or Ariana Grande or Jada Smith - like even if Jada is so gross to be hooking up with a child her son's age, that's not really what people in general focus on as much as, you know, her cheating/cucking poor Will Smith - it's such a tired excuse that seems to only be available to men. \n\nI'm not criticising you here, just in general. The way we frame famous men cheating and the way we frame famous women cheating is so wildly different I wish we'd keep the same energy for all cheaters. \n\nAnd btw, I don't think she needed the money as much as she needed to accomplish her own personal life goals of having a husband, having a family, having a stable home etc that she probably felt was easiest to find with Beckham than anyone else. As other people pointed out, her family was actually worried about him taking advantage of her wealth at the time! So highly unlikely that was a factor to her decision making.",
            "I mean, when he raped a woman?\n\nEDIT: I mean I know he's been sanctified since he died tragically etc — if he hadn't, the narrative around him would be very different today. But he was accused of rape, first admitted to having sex with the woman then had his PR slander her in the press, then settled out of court, and Vanessa showing up with that huge rock was definitely part of it. He did some good things, both for the sport and outside of it, using his status as an elite athlete, but he was also a sexual assaulter at the very least, and Vanessa choosing to stand by him through it is a very different conversation than Victoria taking back Beckham after he cheated.",
            "OH I completely forgot about the schoolteachers rumours, I was thinking about Rebecca (?) like, a decade plus ago.

It's all part of the same mindset. I say this as a pretty hardcore sports fan and don't mean it in a value judgement sorta way, but it's very telling the way so many male sports stars talk about the women they share a life with — beautiful supporting characters — compared to how they talk about teammates or coaches or opponents, who all get to be perceived as the main characters of their own lives.\n\nAnyway this is all to say. I'm sure Messi has a great marriage but I wouldn't be shocked if it came out he cheated either.",

I think she seems so phoney to be honest that if she truly didn't get over it or doesn't trust him the public would never have an inkling or clue.

I’m not trying to downplay her successes at all, I just (in my own opinion) think that their marriage definitely didn’t hurt her finance or status at all.

And please don’t forget this: life is always, always to be celebrated.”\n\nFormer captain David Beckham, who led England under Eriksson at three major international tournaments, was in attendance as well as other members of the team from 2001 to 2006 when the Swede managed the side. Beckham was pictured hugging Eriksson’s former partner partner Nancy Dell’Olio inside the church.\n\nEriksson’s coffin arrived at Fryksande church at around 7am local time, long before the arrival of any of the 600 guests who are expected to be present. A single bell tolled as his body was carried into the church.\n\nMembers of Sweden’s royal family are also expected to be in attendance, with roads surrounding the church in the small town where Eriksson grew up cordoned off by police.\n\nAmong those to arrive early were Eriksson’s father and children as well as a childhood friend of the former Lazio and Benfica coach, Bengt Berg.\n\n“I’m very happy and very sad at the same time,” he said. “But it’s fantastic to see him returning to his first point. It’s a very curious feeling.\n\n“He’s one of us and we share his glory. But when he returned here, he was just one of the hot-dog eaters.”\n\nEriksson died at the age of 76 in August, eight months after revealing he had terminal cancer.\n\nBeckham wrote at the time: “Sven, thank you for always being the person you have always been, passionate, caring, calm and a true gentleman.\n\n“I will be forever grateful for you making me your captain.”\n\n**Full story:** [**https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2024/09/13/sven-goran-eriksson-funeral-david-beckham-torsby/**](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2024/09/13/sven-goran-eriksson-funeral-david-beckham-torsby/)",

            "That's quite a turn of events. \n\nHis wife calls the woman he was cheating on her with, asking about him, and the woman ends up finding him in bed with yet another woman.",
            "The Netflix Beckham documentary handled this in a very interesting way. No-one flat out admitted it, but you can clearly see by body language, and the careful choice of words to all responses, that he cheated. They dealt with it and came through it, but it was not easy and almost broke them…",
            "TIL she is Piers Morgan's second cousin",
            "I offer Rebecca Loos the appropriate condolences for discovering that her married employer, David Beckham, was cheating on both her and Victoria?",
            "This man has always been a cheater and likely has never stopped but VB seems ok with it. I’m not enjoying the misogyny towards Loos second time around and yet again he’s not being held accountable for his actions",
            "She really thought a man who was cheating on his wife with her would be faithful? Girl...",
            "So he cheated on his wife with her and then she’s shocked he cheated on her too? Lmao I mean cheaters cheat girl and if you sleep with a married man you know is married, you’re not any better than him tbh,  sorry",
            "But, but, but David owned Victoria by making her say she wasn't working class!",
            "Going by a certain pro infidelity, infamous affair partner sub, this kind of twist is not uncommon. Rebecca says she felt hurt, distraught and shocked when she saw David \"cheat\" on her, and that's a common reaction because the affair partners on that sub genuinely act shocked when the dishonest POS spouses lie or cheat on them. Suddenly they get all the clarity and trash talk the guy, saying that they all deserve much better men than them anyways and it's their wives sad, but deserving fate to end up with such scumbags. \n\nThey gladly say that when an affair implodes or ends badly, the affair partner wins or is at an advantage because the wives, kids and the family have to carry on with the pain and heartbreak of infidelity or divorce while they get to start over fresh with a better person and don't have any bearings, relevance or reminders of the affair in their brand new relationship. \n\nThe worst is when these affair partners discover that these men are \"cheating\" on them with their own wives by sleeping with them. Apparently lying about a dead bedroom is common among cheating husbands. Affair partners are also awful, miserable people who derive a kind of sick pleasure from secretly one upping a woman/family/man who's done nothing wrong to them. Rebecca's description of how David charmed her into an affair is something very commonly seen with cheaters.",
            "![gif](giphy|BZPv2nPrHYiaM0LJNE|downsized)\n\nRebecca is so upset.",

            "VB is almost definitely aware and they are in an open relationship. They've been together for 24 years. You want to have kids with someone you love and trust. Anybody else is probably just for fun on the side. I honestly think it's a more reasonable expectation for marriage amongst the rich, talented, and beautiful. David still probably has tons of women throwing themselves at him.",

            "I hate how Rebecca Loos is the one getting all the heat while David Beckham, the adulterer, cheat and seedy cunt is getting sympathy for his actions, that he did willingly,  putting his wife through the worst thing imaginable and potentially ruining the lives of not only her, but his 3 infant children.\n\nBut yeah, let's all feel sorry for Beckham because it 'affected his football'.\n\nFuck David Beckham and all the other 'poor me' cheats.",

            "I'm skeptical of any celebrity couple who likes to play up the power couple angle so much like the Beckhams did. They really are getting a resurgence due to the netflix documentary but I've always found everything is about image for them and still is. I might be the same if I was a celebrity but definitely seems like they value the image of things over everything else.",
            "Honestly I can’t with people calling their marriage Open as if it’s fine lmao like it’s “open” insofar as he’s clearly never respected her or their marriage enough not to fuck around on her and he probably initially said the usual “I’m sorry I’ll work on it it meant nothing I love you etc” and she didn’t have the confidence to leave when they were younger/she can’t be bothered to leave now/ after dealing with it for years she just accepted it, I guess? \n\nWhy do people give cheating males the “it’s fine they’re open” no-nuance grace lmao. I’ll never get it. Especially when we would have absolutely heard about some of her fun agreed upon side pieces by now but it seems like it’s only him. Like that’s not ok lol?? That’s not equal, surely you wouldn’t wish a relationship like that on your girlfriends?",
            "How does anyone trust this woman? She loves the attention and money clearly. I'm sure DB cheats. Why is this news?",
            "If you have all that money, why get married in the first place. I just don’t get it, stay free and do what you want without the risks. Evidently he still wanted to mess around anyway.",

            "GOOOOOAAAALLLL",
            "Completely agree with this.\n\nI’ve always wondered if it actually happened or not because there was not really confirmation at the time apart from Rebecca selling the story, but after watching this I’m fairly certain it was true and that makes me really feel awful for Victoria.",
            "They also didn’t deny that it happened, which imo is more telling. They deny a lot of things but not that. Think of Victoria adamantly explaining that she never said “Spain smells like garlic”, for example",
            "It was so interesting. \n\nDavid looked just full of regret and sadness and embarrassment, even 20 years later. \n\nWhereas Victoria seemed more focused on how the media hounded them at the time and feeling like everyone in the world wanted her to leave him and break up their family. Like they were taking pleasure in her misery - and that, to her, was *worse* than what David did.",
            "yes. They did not deny the affair happened, so you know what that is straight away.",

            "I think her point was more, he's the problem. She didn't seduce a married man. He was looking for women to hook up with.",
            "I had a friend that works award shows, he swears blind that Beckham disappeared into the toilet with Katherin Jenkins (the Welsh singer) during one award show (not sure which one)",
            "Misogyny aside (which is a big aside), I’ve noticed there’s a also a lack of sympathy because she sold the story. I wonder how it would have played out if they were caught like Lily James and Dominic West.",
            "why would anyone be sympathetic that a mistress got cheated on?",
            "This isn’t a commentary on her as a person cuz I don’t think/know if she is really that good but it’s definitely embarrassing as hell when the whole world knows how much your husband cheats in addition to the hurt and pain she herself must feel. Since they’re this mega celeb duo it’s probably easier for them ti just stay together, possibly they opened up the marriage or something idk but I just feel like she’s not the one ti blame here",
            "She had to be okay with it. Does anyone here genuinely believe they had a serious conversation to open up the marriage very early on vs. he cheated and she could either choose breaking up the family or living with it?",
            "There’s nothing illegal about his behavior. His wife chooses whether to hold him accountable or not, not the public. Partners decide on their rules.",
            "I think Loos is getting so much hate because she is not a victim. She 100% knew who she was sleeping with and that he was married. She is upset because she says he has acted like the victim in the new Netflix documentary.\n\nThe thing is from his perspective he was the victim. Yes he had an affair which does not make him a good dude but it also does not make him the villain of the story. She was a willing partner. Then she sold her story made the private affair a public spectacle for cash. He is the victim of that.",
            "It seems to me this girl is bitter VB is ok with it and there isn't much drama to milk, again. She wasn't even mentioned nor made a villain, so I miss the purpose of keep STILL bragging about it decades later and when the couple is still together. I'm also sure no one forced her to have an affair with a married man, either. \nMysoginy is always a given when we talk about women but let's not pretend there isn't any towards Victoria too. The main, true purpose of these stories is never really making the man accountable: they want to hurt and belittle the wife thus another woman.",
            "Exactly",
            "They always think they are special",
            "In that little clip I saw DB:”BUT WHAT DID YOUR DAD DRIVE YOU TO SCHOOL IN DURING THE 80s”\n\nVictoria:”….a rolls”",
            "Like at the Scandoval reunion, Raquel was taken aback to find out Tom and Ariana were still sleeping together",
            "I’ve known about two people like this and this exact mentality is why I can’t feel sympathy for affair partners. If you know how he is first hand, a cheater, then it’s kind of obvious what’s going to happen and you’re going to look delusional being shocked or upset about it. Both people I knew were turned on at the thought of that man hurting another woman (aka their wives) for them and tbh, that seemed to be their favourite part. It is truly sickening to watch someone in such blissful glee talk about how the man they’re seeing lies to their wife. But when it happened to them, they were upset that I didn’t care lol. People will go on about how misogynistic it is to say even one negative thing about female affair partners, but being happy and getting off on another woman’s pain being internal misogyny is rarely brought up. It’s ok not to have sympathy for someone like this. \n\nTbh there was no reason for this woman to pipe up again 20 years later- holding David accountable is none of her business, not her job and not her place. They didn’t mention her or blame her at all in the documentary so she needs to stop feeling sorry for herself and go away.",
            "As someone who was cheated on by an average guy who cheated with a pretty average woman— I don’t think anyone is immune to it. A man who wants to cheat will cheat",
            "Cheating is about an insecurity or void in the cheater. A real stand up guy would tell his partner he’s struggling with the relationship first and or end it before moving on to someone else.\n\nThat’s why it’s not about looks and beautiful women get cheated on too. It’s all about the moral character of the cheater. They lack personal integrity.",

            "I hate this take. You do not have to be “beautiful enough” for your man to not cheat. The responsibility is NOT on the one cheated on.\n\nThe man makes the decision himself - that choice is on him.",
            "It’s got absolutely nothing to do with looks.",
            "The idea that the 'attractiveness' of a woman has a direct impact on her chances of being cheated on is so wrong. It's painting the woman as the reason this happens. Her not being good enough to deserve not being cheated on. That's so wonky.\n\nThe chances of being cheated on are a direct consequence of how disgusting and untrustworthy a partner is. It's the cheaters issue with their moral character. \n\nI know you are probably joking but it's an awful way to look at it and I sincerely hope people don't actually think that way. \n\nI'm a guy for what that's worth.",
            "They don’t want a more gorgeous woman… they just want a different one. Looks have nothing to do with it",
            "Nah. Cheating isn't about you, it's about the other person. A good person will treat you well no matter who you are, a bad person will treat you bad *no matter who you are*. \n\nIt's a fallacy to think you can somehow \"out-hot\" someone else's poor character",
            "[deleted]",
            "Maybe dont put on a lack in the cheatee, but see it as a moral failing of the cheater?",
            "It has nothing to do with the woman, so we don’t need to put gorgeous celebrities on such a pedestal. If you decide to choose an insecure partner with a wandering eye, then that’s the problem. Secure, loyal men do exist!",
            "I will never get over the fact that Jay-Z cheated on Beyonce. Like, she has it ALL - beauty, she's independently wealthy, has immense fame- and it still wasn't enough for that man?",
            "there’s a part of me that’s sometimes like, maybe this is just inevitable 🫠",
            "Repairing \"unique mishaps\" (*love that phrase, btw*) to create truly one-of-a-kind pieces is another way to describe the Japanese art of **Kintsugi**.\n\nUsing a precious medium like gold, or in your case time & life experiences, to reconnect the factory-issued pieces into a truly individual work of art means the result won't be right for everyone, but it WILL be right for someone who appreciates that flaws can be highlighted in order to enhance the beauty and quality of the piece. \n\nPlease note: I don't want to dismiss your feelings.  I understand what you're saying & the anxiousness you expressed, and that is valid.  I'm simply hoping to provide you with an alternate way of looking at things so that you don't fall into a cycle of self-doubt.",

I’ve been cheated on before, none of them were very smart.  \n\nThe smartest guys I’ve been with have, at worst, been indirect and flighty leading up to a breakup.

            "Honestly, whether the Beckhams have an open marriage or not, I’ve never ever thought of them as “loveless” and “together for the brand” I’m such a long time fan and they seem to genuinely enjoy each other and their family.",
            "There’s no guarantee they’d find better relationships if they divorced or that their relationship with each other would be better if they suddenly had to navigate custody and other concerns. Again toxic couples shouldn’t be together but some people are kinda idealistic about “being together for the kids” being some inherent evil.",
            "Divorce typically lowers the standard of living for both parents and forces the kids to shuffle back and forth for the rest of their childhood. Abusive/ high conflict relationships should be terminated immediately, but falling out of love seems like a bad reason to upend a child's life.",
            "Eh, your parents not having the best marriage but keeping the family intact can sometimes be easier to navigate for children than all the complexities that come with divorce.",
            "well yeah because her neck is covered by hair lol. regardless the scooter ride was already way inappropriate for a married man",
            "Someone asked this on the scientific parenting Reddit and for the most part kids are happier when the parents stay together. Children of divorce are worse off. I’m going to try and find it.",
            "This for sure! I think parents who get along well but are clearly not romantically involved anymore/have still found what works are totally fine. \n\nMy own parents are still married and my childhood was marked by pretty acrimonious, awful, violent fights with constant reassurances from my mother that they were staying together \"for the kids\". I think that's where this comes from - kids feeling like the weight of a toxic/bad marriage is on their shoulders. \n\nTotally different than \"we're not together but we'd just rather work this way so long as neither of us are actually unhappy about it\". Kids are okay with complex parental/family relationships, it's the part where it bleeds into harming them because it's dangerous that needs to be called out.",
            "I agree, it really seems like they like each other and have a good time together. If you've found a good life partner, why give that up? You can, in fact, have it all.",
            "Right? They seem like they’re truly besties.",

Native speakers know *how* to speak their language to communicate/participate effectively, but often they don't *know* how. Tons of people, if asked whether something is correct/why something in their language is the way it is, will not be able to say more than \"it just sounds right/wrong.\" This is true in basically every language; the only difference you're going to find is whether there's a high standard of grammar education across a whole country. IME the average Syrian knows much more Arabic grammar than the average Egyptian, for example, and that's mainly about education - nothing to do with language itself.\n\nI (native English speaker) happened to go to a school that took grammar really seriously.

            "Honestly, this doesn't sound like he changed as a person at all (wrt the \"moving heaven and earth\" to \"casting aside\"). He sounds like someone who always puts what he wants first, regardless of those around him. He prioritized his relationship at the expense of his teammates, he prioritized his career at the expense of his relationship, and he prioritized getting laid at the expense of his family. This is consistent behaviour over his life.",
            "My dad was like that. Super ambitious career wise. Love-bombed my mom early on in their relationship, was super excited about having a big family with her.\n\nHe kept moving around for his work. During one move, my mom couldn't follow. He found a job across the country w/o consulting her. We had literally just moved into our new family house. Me and my brothers were at an age where we simply had to focus on school. So my mom didn't follow him. He cheated soon after, \"because she wasn't there to support him\".\n\nMen like that need a mother more than a partner. And the moment the \"mom\" is not there, they go out looking for a \"nanny\". Especially if they've never really been on their own and have gone from their family straight into a serious relationship, they simply don't have the stamina to emotionally support themselves.",
            "I’m immediately suspicious of OTT displays of affection because I feel there’s a direct correlation between that effort and how awful he turns out to be later lol. Maybe thats cynical and I know ~not all men~ but my most traumatic relationships have been with the guys who started off driving hours to spend a few minutes with me, spending a lot of money on me, etc. \n\nI actually warn my friends against it too and I’m almost always right.",
            "It’s the risk  you get with men like that. They are always looking for constant excitement, validation , and love. I remember the girl that had the alleged affair was an assistant and claimed Victoria was rarely home in Spain. Unfortunately, David didn’t resist temptation. Victoria has her reasons for staying.",
            "You have to find someone who wants to be a team. And you have to cultivate that together. It's possible but it's work. And then it's also great and something you rely on. \n\nBut in the same way your house and car need preventative maintenance, so does your relationship. But both people have to be willing to do the work.",
            "This is not what it is like being married to every man, though it is common for people to be more focused on relationship building and showing their best side earlier on in a relationship than they are later.\n\nThe situation with Beckham (and I didn't watch the documentary so I'm going on what you say) is unusual because wealthy, high status people conduct their lives differently than others. \n\nI've been with my husband for 36 years and he has gotten even more attentive and caring toward me as I've gotten older. He doesn't do it to \"win\" or \"keep\" my affection as those are eternally his and he knows I'll always adore him no matter what. He does it because he loves me and wants to make my life better as age makes me struggle more. The choice of person you share your life with matters a lot. Choose for personality/compatibility, not for looks or income or whatever superficial thing you may think is integral. In the long run, character will impact your relationship more than anything else.",
            "> This has happened to Posh Spice and Beyoncé at this point, and I am just a mere mortal.\n\nCelebrity marriages are more volatile, not less. So I wouldn't assume that if it happened to them, a regular woman has no chance of finding lasting love.\n\nI'm sorry this happened to you. I don't think every man is like that. There are great guys out there. But it can be difficult to predict how a man is going to be 10 years down the line from the outset.",
            "Honestly the whole narrative saddened me because it’s so typical. The excitement and the chase in the beginning… then being forced in certain circumstances, making sacrifices, then poof. One can only hope that it’s all worth it in the end, and that the same will be done on the flipside.",

            "This is definitely not my experience in relationships but my husband is no David Beckham 🤣",
            "I dated a guy for a bit who was OTT at the beginning then went almost radio silent when I agreed to be exclusive with him. After a few months, I had to be the one to break up with him after we hadn't seen each other in so long. It was like a night and day change. I'm glad he did that at the beginning of the relationship rather than bailing after years.",
            ">  This has happened to Posh Spice and Beyoncé at this point, and I am just a mere mortal.\n\nIt is important to keep in mind that when people cheat it is never their partner's fault. It's not because we weren't good enough. They cheated because it is their nature. No one is beautiful all the time. Life will always have difficult periods. During those periods, some people will cheat and some won't. The key is to identify who is loyal and trustworthy early on. The only thing we can actually control is who we make ourselves vulnerable to.",
            "I’m so sorry you have experienced something like this, and this documentary has caused you pain. I’ve been thinking about it a lot too.\n\nTo maybe ease your mind about future relationships little bit- this documentary was made to generate good PR for David and Victoria. Even if it paints David in a negative light at times, it still makes him look remorseful, introspective, and a man wise with age. Celebrities would not make a documentary that would make them look truly bad. The true situation is likely very different. The rumors and blind items about David’s cheating started while they were dating and continue today. I am sure they loved each other and still do in a way but celebrity relationships are so different from ours. Both of them were and probably still are constantly propositioned for sex. I can imagine lifelong monogamy doesn’t make a lot of sense for either of them, but the public LOVES a long term married couple. \n\nCelebrity marriages are more like businesses than actual relationships. The Beckhams continue to make so much money off their “brand” as a couple. \n\nThis is not to say that non-millionaire-soccer-playing-10 pack-wielding-men do not do what David did to Victoria in the documentary. They have nothing if not the audacity. I do think that it’s hard to compare normal relationships with celebrity ones, even if we do experience the same pain that they do.",
            "Priorities like children and the partnership of marriage are things that can really change the perception of a move.  It goes from aspirational, interesting and ambitious to daunting and nerve wracking - the logistics of which can't be achieved easily with one mind alone. \n\nI have the opinion that most men don't view marriage as a partnership consciously *and* subconsciously, but view it at the very least unintentionally or subconsciously as acquiring a servant, cheerleader or supporter.   For every ten men who overtly treat their wives as bang maids, there's another twenty who do so unintentionally or thoughtlessly.  Such is their privilege of being the \"default\" person.",
            "Aww poor him he’s so sad that he hurt her 🤮",
            "I think it’s important to differentiate between two different realities:\n1. There are men who love bomb you, put you up on a pedestal, keep it up for months to years only to pull the rug out from under you dramatically => trauma that your relationship either survives or doesn’t \n2. In a long term relationship it’s not always going to be sunshine, rainbows and intense passion/excitement for each other. That is, you’re going to have the highs and periods where you’re super connected and in love, and the periods where one or both of you is more distant - either because life stuff gets in the way, you get out of sync, one of you is dealing with something, etc.  During that time it can be lonely and isolating, you could drift apart to a certain extent - but then if there’s truly love at the core of your relationship, there’s a way to come back together, rebuild, reconnect and be stronger than ever.",
            "Don't take relationship advice from celerities. Especially a documentary that's heavily edited and/or scripted to make them seem relatable.",
            "This has been a pattern in my life - not necessarily love bombing but really going the mile at the beginning and “locking” me in. Then after a while just taking me for granted. I think men are designed to conquer, once they do, it eventually fades.",
            "The pursuit and conquest of beckham was probably his only goal. Once achieved, he probably realized quickly that he would be accountable and responsible for  all the lies he told her during the love bomb. Being a good husband/partner is work. Being a good father/parent is work. Being a responsible adult is work.\n\nMost people want the romance, the fucking, and the entertainment; they don't want the accountability, responsibility, and the work.",
            "He is notorious for cheating on her throughout their marriage and it's kind of an open secret that they have only stayed married all these years to protect their brand.\n\nIf anything, the Beckhams demonstrate what happens when you marry a man who has women constantly throwing themselves at him. Sadly, I don't think any man in his position would have stayed faithful for 20+ years of marriage.\n\nThankfully most of us will never have to experience what it's like to be married to someone like David Beckham, but I still think that the more conventionally attractive, powerful, and rich a man is, the more likely it is that he will cheat.",
            "I know it's not going to be popular here, but I used to identify as a man and was married to a woman who was a local celebrity.\n\nHer job always came first and I always supported her and put myself second. I always figured that she would do the same when I really needed support one day.\n\nThen that day came and she left me and we got a divorce.\n\nShe ran her life in such a way that there was never any room for problems outside of her job. Her stress level and commitments were always maxed out. When I really needed help, there was no room for me at all, she had always been married to her job and I had been to blind to see it.\n\nWhen you're married to someone who is married to their job already, you're never going to be the center of their lives. She was a kind and loving woman but she just loved her career more than she loved anything else, even though it took so much from her and me, alike.",
            "There are loyal men out there. They may not be as smooth as the love bombers though. I think making sure you are really friends as well as lovers is important. They also have to like strong women, and not worry about things like if she is more successful, etc. They should also have an ability to make platonic women friends, and to be appropriate with attractive women as the bare minimum. They have to be okay with you as a flawed equal, not a fantasy. They can be crazy about you and lustful, but they are not treating you like a trophy that they can replace. Make sure you don’t feel bought, I guess. \n\nMy husband isn’t perfect, he can be moody, but he’s pretty great as a human. In my husband’s case, there were less overt romantic gestures and more nurturing, more sharing the load. Things like: bringing me groceries in college, securing an apartment together, rather than flowers and champagne and sweet nothings.\n\nAnother example: I had cancer and we had a new baby. He had a new job and he managed it all ( job and first time parenting to a newborn) while I was in the hospital for a long time with complications. We also went through a dead bedroom phase afterwards due to the complications and pain, and he was very patient about it, only getting sad when I stopped wanting to cuddle because I thought it would lead to the sex I couldn’t have. I could have been better about acknowledging his loneliness, tbh. \n\nRecently, I even told him that I didn’t ever want to know, but if he did cheat on me during that time, I understood. It was a long dry spell. (He gets hit on a lot.) He told me in the sweetest, softest way that I never have to worry about that with him. Now I am chasing him a lot and he loves it. The other night he got tipsy and he started giggling as he fell asleep and he said, “You really seem to like me.” I have to remind myself that he might not always communicate his anxieties to me, but I should be careful with his feelings. A healthy love is work even if it is also easy and warm.",
            "When they get comfortable, they no longer feel the need to work to get you. It’s a classic tale of loving the chase. \n\nI don’t think it’s a huge problem because I think atp, Victoria doesn’t really care if he goes or stays, she just doesn’t want to deal with the media onslaught that will come with a divorce.",

            ">is this what life will be like if you choose to get married to a man?\n\nNo, this is what happens when you get married to a super ambitious man who is arguably more into his career than he is to you.\n\nI don't know too much about the Beckhams, but as far as the Carters go:\n\n1.) Beyonce didn't become 🌟✨Beyonce✨🌟 until after she married Jay-Z, and arguably only because she married him. I don't know these people and I don't know anything about their relationship other than what they publicly present to the world but I'd be willing to bet money that at least during one of their arguments some form of \"I made you\" was said, from him to her, especially since:\n\n2.) She was 19 when she started dating a 31-year-old Jay-Z who at the time was arguably a much bigger star than she was. She's 42 now. Prior to that, she spent most of her life under the thumb of her father who was also her manager. \n\n3.) He's a street hustler from Brooklyn. If you've never met one of those types, let me just tell you that they are some of the smoothest talkers you will ever meet. Men like that can talk their way into and out of everything.",
            "Beyonce and posh spice are mere mortals too just like us, and not every man has David Beckham's stardom and money. That is not a guarantee that a man won't f you over, but that kind of f you money gives people a bizarre egotism to do anything.",
            "I watched the documentary too recently and it just seemed like everything revolved around David’s career. They moves were always difficult for Victoria but she just had to roll with it. \n\nI think men are very vulnerable when they lose their emotional support, which they almost always get from their wife mostly. Women can’t let the ball drop when it comes to being there for their husbands emotionally. Men seem to get really lost once that happens and they don’t think optimally.",
            ">is this what life will be like if you choose to get married to a man?\n\nFor some people, yes. For some people, no. You've taken like three examples and extrapolated them into a universal rule of male human nature. \n\nIn the case of David Beckham, I think *some* of the things (like being away from home a lot and not spending as much time with his family as they'd like) are kind of a predictable part of being married to a professional athlete or to most people with a hugely high-powered career. Like, that's kind of what you sign up for by marrying a professional athlete. \n\nOther stuff, though -- the infidelity and missing the birth of his child -- that's just extremely shitty of him.",
            "He was giving her, a \"tolerable level of permanent unhappiness.\" Look it up.",
            "> it looks like Victoria and him are in a great place now. They seem like a really loving family and he seems proud and happy to be a dad and husband.\n\nThis is pretty common - men finally wanting to be a husband and father late in life. But they know that they won’t get that life if they wait too long. So they become a husband and father early when they’re not ready and aren’t interested, just to lock a woman down.\n\nThe solution is to find someone who genuinely wants to be a husband and father, walk that walk and live that life, *at the same time they are asking you to do it.*",
            "The industry is also toxic and promotes all kinds of unhealthy behaviours - cheating, addiction, etc.  The music, entertainment and sports industries are not known for attracting level headed, even tempered people and being on the road around so much temptation and with volatile people is night and day different from most people's ordinary lives. \n\nAdd in controlling, powerful management teams and abusive practices and you have a recipe for chaos",
            "I’m glad I haven’t watched this yet because I’d have thrown my TV. I didn’t know he cheated on her, and now I’m livid. I always thought they’d done well as a couple and were one of the few who had made it. And I assume they’re still together, but fuck that. Another man who knew it was wrong but did it anyway. And missing the birth of his child? \n\nWomen deserve better than this.",
            "Other people have said it well - moving heaven and earth IS the red flag. It’s all idealism and ego. I think people go wrong because they are taught love is excitement and grandiosity. When real genuine safe love is CALM. It’s someone that consistently has your back and shows up in all the ways - it’s not excitement and butterflies and big gestures.",
            "It can happen, but it isn't a given. My husband loves me and loves being around me just as much now as when we first met, but my ex definitely liked me more when we were first dating than when we got divorced. \n\n...also if I were you, I wouldn't assume that Posh Spice and Beyonce are somehow better than you, a \"mere mortal.\" I generally think famous people are insane, men and women both.",
            "It sounds like work came first, and even if in the courtship phase it didn't seem that way, he was playing at home so could make it work.

            ">but is this what life will be like if you choose to get married to a man?\n\nDepends on which man you marry and your ability to use good judgment, cut off people who don't meet your expectations.\n\n>Where at one point, they’d move the earth and heavens for you and then, when they get comfortable, cast you aside to do what they want and just hope you put up with it because they love you? \n\nGoogle hot/cold, manipulation tactics, love-bombing\n\n>This has happened to Posh Spice and Beyoncé at this point, and I am just a mere mortal.\n\nSo are they.\n\nYou can't every control every person/outcome, your goal is to live your best life and not expect anyone to make you happy/complete.

            "I've had this happen with women and NB people in dating too, so I don't think it's exclusively a male problem (though it may be more common with men - not sure). I've even experienced it in close friendships to some extent. I think it can be related to a number of things, e.g. attachment issues, taking people for granted, and/or an abuse cycle of love bombing, devaluation and discarding.",
            "I have a different opinion here. When you are Greta at something, like really great at something - that doesn’t come along often. To be one of the best in your sport is a rarity. It takes exceptional skill and devotion. It’s part natural talent and part development. Beckham was one of the best in the league. Similar to football in the US, you’re going to move around for that career. It’s not like he’s at some office job and making the choice that he’s bored and needs something new. I don’t think that gives you a reason to cheat. I just don’t think moving it’s totally out of the norm for his career.",
            "That wasn't the only woman he cheated with, he constantly sought women when he works abroad even until 4 years ago (as far as I know). The problem is just him and he needs to fix himself, doesn't classify as all men.",

            "I think what's interesting is as you said, when he was alone, lonely without family- he cheated. Women are often put in the position of coping for them. I feel like this is sometimes a result of 'men' (or rather men's culture) not coping with their emotions from a young age. Just bottle it up. Don't talk about it.\n Sure some men just want to cheat. But usually (aside from being sexually 'free') it's covering other problems. If you feel sad, drinking feels good to distract.  If you're alone and unsupported,Sleeping with women is an easy way to feel disposable connection and ignore difficult emotions. \n\nI don't think this is over sympathizing, I think the docu shows he could be self focused and nearly broke his marriage. He seemed to learn his lesson by going too far and was lucky VB decided to continue being married.\n\nMy takeaway is the way women seem to be stuck with either the aftermath, of certain men's emotional fragility and discomfort avoidance.",

Look at the dude's career. 99.99% of men don't have jobs like that. What you're describing isn't the risk of being married to a man, it's the risk of being married to someone whose career is *also* very important to them. \n\nThere are plenty of people out there who have day jobs and see them as just jobs, not things they do because they're passionate about them.

This psychology runs deep in human history.",
            "I really appreciate this post because, to me, when watching this documentary, I have a similar issue that keeps taking away from completely surrendering myself to “liking” Victoria and David as a couple. I feel like there’s a constant elephant in the room that isn’t being adressed: his cheating, which makes “the loving couple” trope seem a bit disingenous. Quite contrary, I feel like I’m watching yet another tale of a woman who chooses to lie to herself in the name of her husband. \n\nFor instance, their denying the Rebecca Loos cheating “rumours” (I still have an episode to go, but read that they deny the affair). Come on, are you kidding me?! Of course they had an affair, and of course Victoria knows, and this “united front” scares the s**t out of me, watching women lie to themselves and for their husband in order to 1. keep up some weird facade of what married life is like, 2. hold on to power, which being married to a man like him probably feels like and genuinely provides, and 3. probably to protect their brand and spin a certain “strong couple” narrative which this documentary really excells at. Let’s not forget that by “standing by her man”, Victoria throws another woman under the bus. If that is not a patriarchy soldier at its finest, I don’t know what is.\n\nIt reminds me of two things: a scene in The Crown where Elizabeth (Claire Foy edition 🙌) visits a female friend who does the then shameful thing of getting a divorce from her cheating husband, and you can see Elizabeth being completely torn; she is furious with Philip who of course cheats all the time. What do you do? Do what society expects of you, accept your cheating husband and bury your own pride and sense of self, AND keep your place in the social hierarchy, or do you expose the hypocrisy and go your own way, disgraced in the public eye, but free and with integrity?  \n\nThe other thing is a scene from the Wayne Rooney documentary where his wife and him are talking about him cheating and what it did to their marriage. And the wife keeps repeating: “I have forgiven him”, like she is trying to convince herself, or she wants to follow up with a “but”. I wanted to scream. What fresh hell is marriage for a woman?! Watching her forcefully trying to convince herself how FINE she was in the name of marriage, and yes, patriarchy, was excrutiating. It’s like, “this is the deal when you marry, you get access to a certain social standing and level of power through your husband, so you better suck it up”. And to see these women just gaslight themselves like there’s no tomorrow makes me think that they accept the premise; they don’t WANT to give up access. \n\nSomeone else here wrote that some men need a mother (or the nanny when the wife is not there “to support him”), a pacifier more than a partner. That is exactly the vibe I get from Rooney, Philip and Beckham, and it saddens me that these systems are kept in check by women too (though I’m not shaming them, I just find the dynamic absolutely depressing). You could do a Shakira and just leave, it IS possible. Also, for me, this spinning of a united front narrative actually takes away from their brand, because it seems inauthentic.",

            "Anyone consider that maybe these two do actually really love each other and the family that they created together. David is a high achieving man and goes through things like any other human but at a greatly magnified level. Victoria understood that in a way that probably few other women can or will want to because she also shot to huge fame really young. They both seem to have strong family values and it sounded like they went to counseling to work through things at some point. I see a man that is growing, reflecting, taking responsibility and a woman who is still in the process of healing but what seems to keep them going from my humble perspective is the love, friendship, commitment and understanding. All marriages have big challenges at some point. Let's do a documentary on the average person's 20-30 year marriage and you will be shocked to see what they have endured together, what they have overcome to get to where they are today.",

But Victoria has a positive and feisty energy about her that I admire. Regardless, they seem to have very little in common as people. I do believe they were in love as younger people, and maybe they bonded over both having been celebrities. I think it would be very hard to be in a relationship with David, personally, as it is being with anyone who is such an obsessive perfectionist and workaholic.",

I was listening to Ester perel and she said something that struck me hard. “Give a woman car keys, job and luxury to be in and out of house anytime of the day or night and then we can compare how far they can go in cheating”\n\nMost of the women are buried by childcare, multiple jobs, chores where do they have time to cheat? That doesn’t mean that women can’t cheat. \n\nIn my entire family, no one ever cheated and being Asian, it’s looked down upon.  Once you marry, you marry forever. In west, marriage is like a contract that can be voided anytime. In west, people marry 3 to 4 times… that’s not marriage, it’s a deal that they do. How can you love someone today and then divorce them like they mean nothing to you. West is more ME centric and that’s what it is sadly",

            "Whoever wrote this has no idea of how football works. Victoria married David knowing he was a profesional footballer. She knew him transferring clubs was a possibility, just like David knew tours and traveling were a part of her career. \n\nManchester United WANTED to sell Beckham, he clearly would have rather stayed with his boyhood club. David had fallen off with his manager, Ferguson never liked Victoria and what he perceived she brought to David’s lifestyle. \n\nThat being said, the club wanted him gone. At the time David was one of the best and most valuable footballers in the world, so it’s very unlikely that United would have sold him to another english team that would compete with them. \n\nBeckham had 2 options at the time, since very few clubs outside England could pay his transfer fee and wages, both teams played in Spain, Madrid and Barcelona. David had few options and little to say on the matter, so he chose Real Madrid. \n\nBeckham cheated and yes he is 100% responsible for that, but Victoria has some blame in my opinion. She knew him moving was part of his career and she took over a year to move in with the kids. They probably knew he was going to move months before it happened. So the excuse that it was because of their kids school was bullshit on her part.\n\nNo way in hell she took over a year to find a suitable school in Madrid, a city as big as Madrid haves plenty of good schools that are bilingual at least. Football clubs are also very accommodating so if she was struggling to find a school the club would have most likely helped. \nSo even if it’s Davids fault she left him alone in Madrid for a whole year. She didn’t support him as a spouse. She chose not to move in with him. Plenty of footballers move clubs and their families follow them without a problem.\n\nAlso her career by that point was dead, there was nothing holding her back to move to Madrid, they have recording studios in Madrid. That being said, David was selfish when he moved to Milan on loan, that move was him changing his mind on what he had agreed with Victoria and also what he wanted for his career. It was a desperate attempt to make the England team for the World Cup and a moment when he wanted to have his cake and eat it too.",
            "If David really prioritised his career over his wife that man would've never been sold to Real Madrid. He was too into his wife, the coach saw that and sold his a**. This narrative that David put his career first is completely false anyone that knows football (basically no one on this sub/r) knows David SHOULD have been the best. Despite what we saw in the docs true football fans know he should've been better.",
            "He is narcissistic. He love bombed her. Spent hours and hours on the phone, bought her lavish gifts, then of course, he cheats multiple times, even while she was carrying his child. David has behaved this way consistently, I do wonder why Victoria stayed.. was it really for the kids? Family? Image? Or was she just so deeply in love with him that she accepted his poor behavior? I don’t know.",

I invited him in and I could tell he really really wanted to. But, he said, he had promised his friend a ride to the airport. Could he go drop him off and then come back? Honestly I gave him props for it. I liked that he didn’t blow off his friend just because he was really into me. He went and dropped of his friend (and his friend later told me he raved about me the entire car ride) and then came back and stayed the night and we cuddled and talked.",

They did exactly what Bob Marley said: \"The biggest coward of a man is to awaken the love of a woman without the intention of loving her.\" My friends' most successful and best relationships were the ones where the man showed genuine interest, but didn't resort to grandiose gestures from the first period of the relationship. And then both sides gradually opened up, shared thoughts, feelings, their past, and came into a mutual embrace. And then love also grew between them.  \nI have to say, however, that only one of the latter relationship types ended in marriage for my friends; it was for the one who is 29 years old and it emotionally very mature and values her good man a lot, while also being treated like a queen. The other two broke up saying it was \"too boring for them\" and one of them missed her abusive ex so much (I guess her brain had become dopamine-soaked from the narcissist ex). However, those two are only 25 years old now, so maybe young to still believe in that breath-taking rom-com romance where you find your other half by instantly falling in love and showered with lavish gifts and super attention.",

Sure people of all stripes and spectrums cheat but celebrities have more access to potential affair partners, but being rich and famous opens up a lot more venues to cheat. I mean, come on, there are plenty of famous men and athletes who have women sneaking into their hotel rooms. I'm not excusing these dudes. But fame, money, adoration - all this can go to people's heads. They get arrogant and end up doing something stupid like cheating. Fame and wealth can ruin people and lead them into bad decisions.",

I couldn’t be with someone who wasn’t supportive.",

So I was not expecting someone with that level of emotional maturity at all. He’s the classic nice guy (a real nice person) and just extremely observant. He can read my body language in an instant. (Although it’s a great trait for a partner, the origin of why he’s like this isn’t so great - childhood trauma and all). We talk A LOT about each other and often times, I find that we’ve become a bit like a therapist to one another. \n\nWe are both extremely invested in helping each other grow. I think partly due to the fact that we’ve been working together for the past 10 years - we’ve gotten really good at communicating our expectations/feelings/ideas with one another.",

My take is that if they got together before she went solo - him with more years of life / industry experience under his belt, her as a younger woman, of course he was going to be advising her and also informing that move into being a woman, in how she presents herself etc. \n\nSo I could see that leading to feeling dependent on him in some way, or a certain power dynamic.

Beyoncé was a middle/upper middle class Texas girl who went to private school and sang in Catholic church and did beauty pageants and talent shows on the weekends. Jay-Z pushed drugs in the streets of Brooklyn to survive. Being with Jay-Z definitely influenced her career and her musical direction, especially as she backed away from mainstream pop. It was both heartbreaking and unsurprising to hear that he had cheated on Beyoncé, his sort of musical protégé turned superstar wife, not when she was in her Crazy in Love/Single Ladies days when his features elevated her status but when she became ✨Beyoncé ✨the legend who now basically uses his adlibs for background vocals. Even though her musical fame has far exceeded anything he ever accomplished, these two were never going to split after he cheated. Their brands are inextricably linked. \n\nOn a less serious note, he gave us the hand flip that’s iconic to Single Ladies, so shout out to him for that I suppose."

            "Ok I just watched it on YouTube and honestly this isn’t the same thing at all. He just lumps it forwards and it bounces over the keeper. No way he’s trying to score. This is the same thing as Tim Howard’s and Paul Robinson’s goals for Everton and Tottenham respectively. Long hoof upfield and a lucky bounce is in no way the same thing as a beautiful chip from halfway.",
            "The weight of the ball has been unchanged in the laws of the game since 1937. Balls being heavier in the old days isn't a complete myth, because they'd get soggy in wet weather, but it's not that true either.",
            "That's insane. They'd probably start talking about him if Bayern wins the Bundesliga (that's even expected every year) or if Kane's performance in the euros would be huge. But unless Jude drops off or gets a consecutive stinker, we won't probably hear other names.",
            "NOPE I'M NOT LISTENING LALALALA YOU CAN'T MAKE ME SEE IT",
            "I'd throw in Cesc",
            "3 times actually. One for United and one for Everton, both against West Ham. And then one for D.C United.",
            "Alonso did it twice at Liverpool",
            "There are quite a few players who have achieved it nowadays. Also I think there is a distinction to be made:  was the keeper up for an attack or was he just standing too far ahead of his goal? If you only count the latter, it narrows it down quite a bit. If you count the former, the most impressive of them all is from the Bundesliga imo. Moritz Stoppelkamp scoring agains Hannover, from a distance of 82 meters. We won’t see that repeated any time soon.",
            "I actually prefer Rooneys goal at West Ham to Beckhams because it was a half-volley and he had amazing anticipation, with less time to think and set himself. But Rooney wasn't in his own half\n\nRooney; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTjfMV0LCkQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTjfMV0LCkQ)\n\nBeckham; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raLRd9Z6SrQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raLRd9Z6SrQ)\n\nKane; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaJrXe6dOcI",
            "Yeah,both  against West ham. Alonso did it twice for us as well. Suarez v Norwich is my favourite though as doing a hatrick of hatricks against the aame club is ridiculous, but to complete it by doing it from the halfway line took the piss.",
            "Really good but still just a friendly",
            "Most aesthetically pleasing has to be Stankovic vs Shalke for me. A young Neuer with a diving header clearance only to see Stankovic connect with it on a volley from the halfway line and send it straight into the net. [Link](https://youtu.be/nRQRyrg7Xxw?si=jIe-MZnVIoClvwfr). Granted it's from just inside the half but still gorgeous technique.",
            "It sounds unlikely, but then you have to remember that prior to the 90s teams tended to play with a sweeper between the defensive line and the keeper, which made it less likely for keepers to be off their line.",
            "I only started watching in the mid-2000s, but maybe it's because goalkeepers didn't come out as far in earlier times?",
            "Yes, but it’s a game played mainly in autumn, winter and spring, so the ball was wet most of the time.\n\nI think you’ve got the wrong end of the myth - the ball was as light as today occasionally, but usually it was wet and heavy.",
            "OK then not technically heavier but because of the materials used it didn't bounce as much, didn't swerve as much and was much harder to kick a distance. All of which would also happen if it was heavier, so no wonder it seemed heavier.",
            "One of those against West Ham was on the volley as well which as far as I know has never been done by anyone else.",
            "can still picture harper flapping on the floor like a fish out of water",
            "> We won’t see that repeated any time soon.\n\nWe get the occasional goal kick go in to be fair",
            "Yeah I mean that one is just next level insane. Not to mention it happened 20 seconds into the game.",
            "Not in Britain, that was viewed as continental football that was only very, *very* occasionally dabbled with.\n\nKeepers weren’t as high up as they are now in the top teams, but they did roam around their penalty box.\n\nI think people just hadn’t thought of doing it, which is why there have been so many since. It was a genuinely surprising thing to see at the time, whereas now it’s a thing.\n\nDoesn’t make it more physically difficult, but it was the imagination to try it which was so surprising at the time.\n\nWhether it was the first one or not, who knows? It certainly felt unique at the time. But not because everyone played with sweepers. Teams didn’t play with sweepers in Britain back then.",
            "I know Britain has a reputation for being rainy, but it's not sensible to say that the ball was soggy and heavy most of the time. And that's before considering that football is played worldwide, in climates drier than ours.\n\nThe key misapprehension in the myth, though, is the belief that the ball was heavier when dry anyway. People tend to say the ball was especially heavy when wet, but the assumption is implicit.",
            "I was thinking Stankovic vs Schalke but he was further forward\n\nstill one of my favorite all time goals",
            "on the volley to complete the hat trick. what a player",
            "Yeah but I’d say those are a completely different category. That’s just pure chance, there is no intent to score a goal. It’s always funny when it happens, but it’s more similar to a botched cross going in.",
            "Yet Inter still lost",
            "So it’s very often rainy when the games played, but it’s not “sensible” to think the ball would be wet when used? That’s not very good logic, especially when you look at what the pitches were like at the time.\n\nAnd what people who actually played at the time say.\n\nI think you’re demonstrating the modern misapprehension, not explaining it away.",
            "That one was much closer, but quite possibly the best goal from a technical difficulty perspective.",
            "Yeah! After Neuer came out to clear a ball with a header",
            "That Stankovic goal is such a great one. \n\nEven Zlatan would be proud of that goal if he scored that.",
            "Yeah crazy to think Schalke was in CL semis just a decade ago",
            "I said Britain has a reputation for being rainy. I should have been explicit: reputations can be exaggerated and should be doubted. My point is that it's not raining as often as all that, even in a land as supposedly wet and miserable as ours.\n\nAs for the misapprehension, which I stated is that the balls were heavier when dry? Beats me why you think I'm demonstrating it. \n\nI hope we don't drag this out any longer.",
            "My dad used to talk about this actually and how the ball wasn't heavier most of the time .. but it was the laces that really hurt your head.",
            "I’m happy to bow out with the observation that, if you don’t think the winter weather in Britain is predominantly wet, then that says everything about your assertions, really.\n\nYou want to come up with a new take, and so are ignoring reality."

            "I love how they STILL skirt around this with the “alleged”. It wasn’t just loos either there was another woman before her who had texts. Loos also claimed he was cheating with a model too.",
            " There’s something about Victoria Beckham I like, I don’t know why I think I feel sorry for her and the hate she’s had from tabloids and people picking apart her body constantly and moaning that she doesn’t smile.",
            "Those texts were definitely David, he is very lovey dovey (emotionally needy). One of the most stand out things he always says in this doc, is how he 'NEEDS' his family around him at all times to be emotionally stable.",

They felt it was the safest World Cup they'd had for a long time.\"  David Beckham says he was 'proud' to be an ambassador for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar\n\nOh fuck off.  Oh yes the \"LGBTQ community\" felt safe in a country where it is illegal to be homosexual and if anyone wore any type of rainbow anything or supported the LGBTQ community they were forced to remove it and when they would not remove it or wear it again they'd be sent to jail.",

            "This was a great doc - just finished it. But overall it made me dislike him lol he’s selfish AF man. VB is too good for him 😐",
            "As an American, I didn't know much about David Beckham back in the day other than he was this supposedly super good-looking soccer player who got Posh Spice pregnant (I looooved the Spice Girls). By the time his cheating came out in the early 2000s, I was in college and not paying attention to celebs. DB came back on my radar recently because he's British royal adjacent, and I follow the Royals. He seemed like a really down to earth, nice guy. \nAfter this watching this documentary, I think the guy is full of sh*t. He won't admit that shaving his head/going for a bad boy image was to rebel and piss off his coach. I highly suspect he allowed his management/PR team to leak the story of him getting hit in the head with the cleat and was all too willing to go along with their plan to wear steri-strips over the cut to make it seem much worse. And him calling out Victoria on where she was going and the type of car her dad drove... ?! She should have poked her head into the room and said, 'Hey, remember when you f*cked all those women at the beginning of our marriage?\"\nI feel that David Beckham has spent the last decade (at least) crafting this image as a down to earth business man, family man, and kind husband, and it's a crock of sh*t.\nAs far as their marriage, I do believe they loved each other very much at the beginning, and, likely, at different times throughout. After watching this documentary, I don't doubt that they are best friends and have mutual respect for reach other,  but I question if there's romantic love and if they are really \"obsessed with each other.\" The release of this documentary has been mutually beneficial as VB just launched a new perfume line - scents named after places where she has a special memory with David. (50mL for $200)\nI think their marriage and both their images have very much been 'stage managed' since the early 2000s, likely the result of him being caught cheating.",

But it looks like he may have had a history of this behaviour, and I don’t think he respects women.\n\nRebecca said in the midst of their affair she then found him with a Spanish model at a Ronaldo party. Might not be true? But I wouldn’t be surprised. And apparently he was showing her texts to friends. Stuff like that just makes me think he uses women.\n\nI do wonder why Victoria stays with him.\nI wonder if their marriage is more a branding/image move.",

Football is a \"masculine\", \"macho\" (yes, i threw up in my mouth using this word) patriarchal mysoginistic sport. I mean, even women who play football are victims sometimes... well, we remember what happened with spain's coach. That's how awful that world is.  I mean, one of the biggest football players has to have a fake gf and ivf made kids to hide that he is gay. And i'm sure he isn't the only one. There have been events when a football fan was beaten up at a stadium because he is gay. Or at least derided and made fun of. Hooligans are the worst. \n\n2. Since lgbt situation in Qatar is well known, and has been posed as an issue during the WC, the authorities have been extremely alert to not have any incident happen. Not for anything, but it would've cost them money and sponsors. So probably that's why they felt safer at this world cup than other world cups when violence against gays wasn't exactly an issue for the organizers.",

            "After watching the new Netflix documentary I think she loves him, but I’m not convinced he likes, let alone loves, her.\n\nHe’s very passive aggressive towards her. It’s subtle but it’s there. I think Victoria Beckham is more intelligent than him, and he knows this and resents it. I also think she has incredibly low self-esteem so has always thought David Beckham is a prize and she’s lucky to have him, when really he comes across as an inarticulate personality-less selfish twerp with deep-seated anger issues, and he is lucky to have her. \n\nHe bangs on about ‘family’ but all his actions over the years have resulted in his family having to trail about after him over the globe and put his needs first. What he really seems to care about is money and fame and attention. That’s it. His affairs point towards someone who mainly thinks about themselves and needs validation and adoration constantly. Men like this always show their true colours when their partners have children and have to divert some of their attention to being a Mother rather than a constant ego-stroker for their man child.\n\nI felt sorry for him for two minutes when we saw the retrospective hate spewed at him after the World Cup 1998 kick nonsense, what a toxic crazy way for people to react, but by the end of episode four, I no longer felt sorry for him and I’m not going to sympathise with someone who has always chased money over integrity. 🤷‍♀️",
            "I think it’s more like Jay Z and Beyonce. They were in love in the beginning but the man cheated and the woman decided to stay because business wise, they are better together than apart. Plus both couples have 3-4 kids. The couple together is a whole brand. Beyonce and Jay Z both made hit albums about his cheating. And remember when “Posh and Becks” first became a thing? Each half of the couple boosted the other person’s profile and vice versa. Divorcing would lose both the wife and husband a ton of past and future earnings. Maybe they even have some sort of open marriage type of aggreement like Will and Jada.",

I pretty often held my kids like that and I am sure many parents do. \nCarrying your baby this way is particularly good if it has a stomach ache.

When he played at Man U there were always stories about what a decent fella he was.  Would make sure that he signed all the autographs for everyone who wanted one. Always nice in public.  Gary Neville lives near me and you would come across Becks in the local supermarket.  Whereas MM believes that her so called talent makes her popular.

            "Just my opinion - I get the impression that Markle felt threatened by Victoria. She was self-made (with a huge fan base) who successfully married a talented sportsman. Like them or not, they’re successful, admired, wealthy etc etc..everything Markle desires. She had an option of using Victoria‘s ‘fame’ (which I think she did early on…wearing Victoria‘s wardrobe etc), but then I think she knew she was out of her depth, she didn’t belong - Harry was their friend, and she was an outsider, so she had to intervene…and we know how that ended up…\n\n…actually, it’s got me thinking. There were rumours of David having an affair (many years ago, but well publicised), so I wonder if it’s occurred to Markle that David may be easily seduced? Have there been any rumours of Markle flirting with David (similar to Serena‘s husband, Alexis)? He’s certainly wealthier than Harry (and better looking)!",

That book was so full of awful stories about MM, essentially laying out how she became the shameless and entitled creature she is, that it blows the mind.

            "I agree, but that attitude is sort of woven into the fabric of the culture. I wouldn’t say I witnessed that attitude often, but I did see some vestiges of it over the years. The Kennedy family, for example, used to be sacrosanct. It was nauseating the free pass the Kennedys would get, regardless of their behavior. Teddy Kennedy retained his senate seat in 1969 despite being involved in the death of Mary Jo kopeckne and had OBVIOUSLY lied about it. I once made a joke about JFK having been a massive womanizer and my friends acted like I had just disparaged their dads. Thankfully, the younger generation is less blindly loyal to that family.",

            "According to Tom Bower, Harry borrowed an LA area mansion from his friends in order for MM to host thanksgiving dinner.

            "But also I think they call it 'coercive control' in UK, it's an actual domestic**He** abuse crime. Or psych/emotional abuse in the US. Or manipulation, narcissism.   \nThe thing is the abuser is *so believable* because they come across as **believing their own story.** Maybe some do. Maybe some narcs convince themselves.   \n**In the case of the parachute attempted murderer for his wife's life ins (UK) where the husband removed parts of her parachute,** not only did he flirt with the policewoman to try and get advantage, he was so scary her superiors told her not to be alone with him--& she was an experienced officer of many years. *Then from prison he attempted to manipulate his (in process of divorcing him) wife.* He was able to get inside her head, basically, and wanted 'more of her time, more of his (v.young) kids' time.' She says in the TV program (it was a UK program so I've only read summary) that she now recognised what he was doing and just cut off all contact.   \n**These are often very smart people, the parachute lady was an expert physiotherapist as well as parachute instructor.** My cousin, also miles ahead of Harry in the brainy department, was also eventually killed by her estranged husband. *They begin with love bombing, grooming, knight in shining armor, etc.* It doesn't stay nice like that. But it tends to blind even smart people to remember that time and blame the bad actions on 'he's just having trouble at work, her Dad's giving interviews, she's stressed, she's such a good mother/took care of me so well/supported me against people who hurt me'--that's entirely more rational when it's emotional/psych/financial abuse. The parachute wife, for example, said her husband had never hit her. But there are criminal laws against coercive control for this reason--a person could get arrested for beating you up, but not for being an asshole. Coercive control, like that Meghan has over Harry, is a specific pattern of manipulation, lies, and asshole acts adding up to abuse. \n\nNONE of this means that Harry isn't responsible for every bit he's done. He had, and has, more resources and options than 99.9% of other victims. He has his own funds, he flies around the world by himself. He's not physically isolated. He was able to call his therapist after the dog bowl fight w/William. He, along with W and C, founded a mental health charity.   \nI'm speaking only to Harry's mindset, and how he can 'buy in' to what Meghan tells him (SHE's not the leak, someone else--an enemy--is the leak). It makes it far easier for Meghan to do this because of Harry's deep paranoias from his own mental health problems.",

            "They did NOT boo William and Catherine.  The media covered this a long time ago, when they interviewed 3 people that booed.  A small group of people in opposing shirts walked into a group of Boston fans.  THAT is what was booed and THAT is why it was just a small handful of people that booed.  I will point out again, thousands of supporters for Wiliam and Catherine showed up at their hotel.  SO many supporters showed up that William and Catherine decided to do an impromptu walk outside to greet ALL the supporters.  As for the Kennedys, just as with Diana and Harry, as more and more info came out about the Kennedy family, their fall from grace began.  I'm most definitely not part of the \"younger generation,\" and I have Never, Ever been a fan of the Kennedy family.  He was absolutely a massive womanizer and came dangerously close to creating a nuclear war.  JFK was seen only as a \"hero\" because he stopped the nuclear war he almost created, he spoke out on civil rights, and, like Diana, died tragically young.  This immortalizing \"celebrities\" as some type of saint just because they die young and/or tragically is ridiculous.  JFK wasn't even President that long!  For some reason all their \"sins\" get over-looked just because they died young.  (Sorry, I have a serious pet-peeve about that, especially in regards to JFK.)",

Men vil for meg personlig gjøre det enda mindre aktuelt å kjøpe dette merket. \n\nNår det gjelder hodetelefoner så er merket og promotøren for min del underordnet. Ser på pris/kvalitet/lydkvalitet etc opp mot mine preferanser.\n\nStøykansellering er litt vanskelig å teste ut når man prøver i et butikklokale. Så her må man nok lene seg litt på upartiske tester. Men merket og hvilke influencer som promoterer dem kan jeg ikke bry meg mindre om.\n\n\nFor en god tid tilbake når Beats var hypet opp kjøpte jeg motvillig et sett med Beats Pro by Dr. Dre til kjæresten. Tor hun ville ha dem pga pris og immage. Tror hun automatisk trodde høy pris = bedre. De var tilsynelatende bygget som en tanks med mye aluminium. Men synest de hørtes latterlig ut. Sikkert ok om man bare hørte på hiphop.  På sikt viste kvaliteten seg å være laber på alt som ikke var aluminium. Padding på ramme og puter flasset av. For en plas soppunder 4000 kroner kunne man nok fått et bedre produkt om man hadde satt markedsføring og utsende til sides.\n\nHar ikke testet nyere B&W eller Beats støykanselerende hodetelefoner. Så aner derfor ikke hvordan disse er.\n\nHar etter utallige timer med bruk/misbruk ikke klart å ta livet av mine Jabra 85h. Og til tross for at støykansellering ikke holder helt mål mot nyere modeller har jeg vært fornøyd med disse. Liker lyden da den er relativt nøytral, og ikke er så basstung som f.eks Sony. Tåler og en del juling og til tross for å ha noe som ligner et stoftrekk tåler de en del vann (IPX4).\n\nBose synest jeg er ubehagelige i lengden. Apple er unødvendig stor og dyr og ser latterlig ut med den \"bleien\"  som man skal tre over for oppbevaring. \n\nOm jeg må kjøpe nye i nør fremtid så aner jeg ikke hva det hadde blitt.

Alternativt er det også så simpelt som at det kan assosieres med kvalitet, ikke fordi personen kan noe som helst om produktet, men fordi forbrukere går ut ifra at en såpass kjent person med såpass mye penger naturligvis bruker \"bra produkter\". \n\nGanske rart å tenke sånn mtp at de får betalt for å bruke produktet, men det er altså en tankegang som eksisterer\n\nOm jeg ikke husker helt feil så var det Rolex som startet hele trenden med \"ambassadører\".

Man kan også få høyttalere med lengre holdbarhet om man ikke er opptatt av design.  \n\nAnnet tips er å huske på at rommet påvirker lyden enormt. Så hvordan høyttalerne høres i butikken og hvordan de høres ut hjemme kan være veldig forskjellig. Butikken har selvsagt prøvd å optimalisere hvor bra høyttalerne høres ut ved å plassere dem i rom og i avstander som gir best mulig lytteopplevelse.\n\nSå kjøper man høyttaler bør man teste dem ut hjemme og ikke i butikken. I tillegg ville jeg sjekket på nettforumer og lignende om holdbarheten på det man kjøper. Det gjelder både det elektroniske om det holder, men også om man kan forvente at relevante apper og slikt får oppdateringer og om høyttalerne kan brukes om appene slutter å fungere. \n\nDette svaret var egentlig ikke ment direkte til deg.

            "Det har vært gjort flere forsøk hvor de har brukt samme oppsett, men bare endret kabelen som overfører lyden. En av \"kablene\" er en kleshenger av metall som har fått sink-belegget pusset av på enden, etterfulgt av en god runde med elektrikerteip.\n\nAudofile har så fått i oppgave å bestemme hvilket alternativ som høres best ut. I noen av testene fikk de vite hvilke alternativer som kunne komme, og der var det så og si ingen av de selverklærte audiofile som klarte å differensiere Monster-kabelen til 50K vs. en kleshenger. I en annen test ble lyd spilt inn over kabel, og så ble folk bedt om å bestemme om ett av lydklippene var bedre enn de andre, eller om klippene var like gode. Der var det flere som likte kleshenger-kabelen, men det var nokså nær normaldistribusjon.\n\nObjektive tester som frekvensrespons og -konsistens viser at kleshengeren er dårligst, men foruten et par frekvenser så er marginene på støyen såpass lav at det er helt umulig å høre forskjell når det er musikk som avspilles.\n\nNår det er sagt så finnes det absolutt gode og dårlige kabler, selv digitale. Standarder som HDMI og USB er ganske rigide, og spesielt når kabler blir veldig korte eller lange så vises det veldig godt om noe er av dårlig kvalitet. HDMI på ca. 10 meter kan virke helt fint på en TV, siden mottakeren klarer å rette opp signalet og takler at hver 1 og 0 ikke er helt perfekte. Mens på en annen mottaker virker ikke kabelen i det hele tatt, og du får bare sort skjerm eller et bilde som flimrer av og på konstant. USB-kabler som er kortere enn 30cm har en tendens til å støye mye, så hvis de ligger nær hverandre kan enhetene kobles inn og ut. Skal du koble på en SDR eller lignende, som trenger svært høy kontinuerlig overføringskapasitet, merker du også fort om kabelen ikke henger med. Jeg vil derfor anbefale å styre unna det aller, aller billigste rælet hvis man har behov utenom det vanlige, men de dyreste kablene er nok aldri verdt det.",
            "De ble ikke kjøpt pga lyden, men merket.",
            "Dr Dre klarte jo faktisk å lage et helt søppel produkt og markedsføre det så bra at haugevis av folk som ikke vet hva som er god og dårlig lyd kjøpte de.\n\nOm du tror kvaliteten på merkevaren har noe som helst å si for oppkjøpet så er du nok på villspor. Det er jo helt absurd høy merkevaregjenkjenning på Beats blant folk, noe billig dritt til dyr pris blir det nok videre også.",

            "Joda, men å dytte 1.4Mbps gjennom en usb-kabel på 1-3 meter er ikke \"behov utenom det vanlige\" -- i steden innebbærer det å utnytte en knøttliten brøkdel av kapasiteten til en moderne usb-kabel.",
            "På jobb hadde vi en rigg som lastet opp firmware til ca. 10 kretskort på en gang, hvor det som ble sendt inn var én overføring på 128 KB, lastet opp med en hastighet langt under 1Mbps. Vi ønsket så korte kabler som mulig for å unngå kveiler med kabler som lå overalt, siden kretskortene bare var ca. 3 cm fra hverandre og klistret fast på en USB hub.\n\nMed billigste typer kabler vi fant, så fikk vi feil etter feil når vi forsøkte å bare spørre kortene om en ID. Dette var en forespørsel på bare et par bytes. Forskjellen der er at USB-kontrolleren på kretskortene ikke takler USB som går alt for langt unna spec, og kablene var rett og slett så dårlige at data ikke alltid kom fram, og støy smittet mellom de pga. nærhet og dårlig terminering. Vi også trodde at det ikke var nødvendig med særlig gode kabler, siden det var lav båndbredde og lenge mellom hver overføring. Men der tok vi smertelig feil.\n\nVi skulle kjøpe ca. 1000 stk. så vi testet dyrere og dyrere kabler til vi fant noe som endelig virket, og så kjøpte vi 1000 av de. For kabler på ca. 20 cm måtte vi ut med 120kr per stk. for noe som faktisk fungerte.",
            "Kablene må være gode nok til at det funker ja og du kan greie å fille billig-søppel som ikke er det.\n\nMen helt gjennomsnittlige kabler fungerer fint, og hadde dere \"oppgradert\" kablene til 120,- pr. stykk til gullbelagte monsterkabler til 6000,- pr stykk hadde det gjort NULL forskjell.",
            "Ja, den er jeg med på. Men det at utnyttet vs. tilgjengelig båndbredde er det eneste som setter krav til kvaliteten på kabelen er ikke riktig.\n\nDet er ingen situasjoner der Monster-kabler er nødvendig. Der det er nødvendig har man såpass eksepsjonelle behov at man antageligvis vil bestemme nøyaktige egenskaper til kabelen selv, og ikke kjøpe hyllevare."

The foreign and domestic actors are flooding bots in now so that they can rack up karma/likes/whatever from mostly harmless memes, and then will pivot to misinformation and propaganda once the elections properly kick in. \n\nPersonally I think that needs to be investigated a bit to see if there’s much truth there, I think the more significant factor is Reddit and other social media’s have started paying people for getting high karma/engagement on posts. It’s not much if you’re a normal user who maybe makes the occasional successful post, but if you control 10,000 bots that can shit out dozens of posts a day then it can be pretty lucrative. The incentive to flood bots in is massive.\n\nIf you’re curious, I suggest that when you find a bot, follow them or make a note of their username or something, and then see what kind of content they’re posting in October.",

That will be people who completed the SBC.

I do think she also got them changed out for smaller ones? \n\nEither way she looks much healthier in the last 2 photos.",

I’m a mastectomy/reconstruction patient and also petite so I just remember telling my doctors at my first consult ‘is my only option bolt ons’ bc as a millennial, I remember the bolt ons well. Lots of botch jobs on 100 pound women back then. I personally think she just looks great now though.",
            "Iirc I think she has finally gotten them either reduced or removed. And agree, she looks so much healthier now.",
            "Oh it’s a slang term for bad implants. Most often on thin women with less natural tissue. It’s where you can see the entire outline of the implant. Like the doctor just ‘bolted them on.’ Think Tori Spelling in 2002. Now you don’t see it as much bc of fat transfers to help contour irregularities. Hell, I have 4 sheets of cadaver matrix holding my implant up. For 100k or so, these celebs can get bionic boobs that look pretty damn good anymore.",

            "I’m almost positive she got her implants replaced with smaller ones because I remember reading an article about it—not gossip or gross speculation. I swear I read about it in the last 10 years. \n\nThat being said I also think that allowing just a shred more body fat has softened the look in addition to a reduction. \n\nIt’s actually really heartening to see the last 2 photos but maybe she doesn’t see it that way. She’s gorgeous and fit but a few of those photos are frankly worrying. The last 2 really seem healthier and I truly hope that she is happy and confident. \n\nI’m a Taylor fan and she had a similar thing going on for a short while. She’s always been enviously thin and fit, but she admits that it got dangerous for a bit. We all celebrate healthy fitness.",

            "Yeah people pretend that what happens in these celebrity relationships doesn't happen in our everyday relationships. A lot of people stay together for financial/business reasons, for the family. As for taking back a cheating partner, people stay with their boyfriends/girlfriends who have cheated all the time. It's probably a bit harder to take them back when the whole world knows what has happened.",

            "I don't know, I think what especially the younger generation tends to forget, is that they didn't need eachother! She was one of the biggest female stars in britain at the time, he made football into a celebrity thing. She could have done the fashion icon, fashion label thing easily without him and he would probably either coach england or be the face of international football tv if he didn't move to the US mostly for her(at least how it's communicated)  On the contrary it always seemed to me that they each took turns in their career which they wouldn't have to do with a no name partner. The whole publicity in their relationship was a phase when they were pretty young and started now up again with the documentary, but there were many silent years as well. And the doc comes at a time when a lot of footballers and musicians got docs. I mean it's pretty possible that you are right as well, I don't know them. I've just watched the England match and remembered watching him play and talked with friends about how weird it always was to connect the great and humble player with the public persona, so this is why I (over)thought this so much ",
            "Yeah, nunya business",
            "Maybe it’s my sappy romantic side, but I just refuse to believe that all marriage is doomed to lose romance and just become a “business relationship”. If that’s what all marriage is doomed to become then I’d rather stay single",

            "I think that’s gonna be me and my husband",
            "Scary Spice was actually in an abusive marriage for ten years. She’s been quite open about it because like most people, she never thought it could happen to her, but it did. (Her ex emotionally, physically, and financially abused her, just to really mess her up.)",
            "Which means she’s great in bed.",
            "Not necessarily. I had a successful honeymooj phase and the trick is keeping it brief. Mine lasted 6 seconds and it was great. Overdoing it is where people tend to go wrong.",
            "If you talk about the constant cheating rumors especially while he was still a footballer: yeah, maybe, none of our business. But also, there are other possibilties like maybe they were in an open relationship and didn't want to share that especially not at a time, people seriously used the word metrosexual or maybe he really didn't cheat or he maybe did and she chose to forgive him, still none of our business\n\n\nShe was always rich and famous independently to him, so she could have walked at any point without taking a big hit and she didn't, so I assume she had her reasons\n\n\nI honestly never thought that I would ever be at a point where I would seriously defend their relationship, but honestly, after the past 10 years just learning that basically all celebrities are sex pests, they nearly seem wholesome with their long lasting marriage without real rumors about abuse and I chose to believe, that it's real, not perfect or fairy tale, but two people trying to live life together ",
            "Mind elaborating?",
            "I don’t know. It seems like Victoria Beckham is the only Spice Girl to have maintained significant star power all these years later and I think her marriage is a key piece of that. I rarely hear about the others but she is often in headlines.",
            "> he made football into a celebrity thing\n\nHahahaha. Oh my sweet summer child. George Best would like a word. Footballers have been start for decades before Becks came along.",

            "I feel like the Dowager Countess would take exception to being called “Granny” lmao",
            "Not to mention that people change, and most marriages have their ups and downs, with times when they love each other fiercely, and times when they can't stand each other. If it's not an actually abusive or otherwise shitty relationship that really should end, the trick seems to be to just hang in there, be decent to each other, and wait for things to change/the wheel to turn to the point where they love and like each other again. (Source: almost everyone I know in a longer marriage, and my parents.)",
            "Wait then who’s the one that went full Tory?",
            "The scene from the doc recently where he buys in and makes her tell the whole truth was about the most married couple thing I’ve ever seen.",
            "Well it’s celeb gossip none of it is any of our business you can’t just selectively say “none of our business” for things that go against your argument lol",
            "We’re talking about different levels though. George the fifth Beatle Best popularized the celebrity style living, fast cars, champagne bottle service, fashion models every week. \n\nBeckham took that lifestyle, global celebrity, and monetized it. He was maybe not the first to even do that, but he was the biggest to brand himself and now every player does this. \n\nRemember there was a whole ass movie called Bend it like Beckham, not bend it like Best. Also, despite Best’s stature, he was never perceived as bigger than the club. He was still in the shadow, as a player, of Bobby Charlton and Denis Law. Busby struggled controlling his off field antics but SAF struggled to reign in Beckham’s overall stardom putting the entire club in his shadow.",
            "The whole point is the “business relationship”. I don’t want a romantic relationship that’s guaranteed to fade and in the end basically just becomes a roommate that I’ve tied myself to in order to go through life. I would 100% rather do life alone than end up with a platonic roommate that I’m stuck with forever.",
            "Yes but she would have used a rapier’s wit to dispense the fatal blow",
            "Agree. But that’s what they all called her! Lol",
            "Exactly. Good days are followed by bad days and bad days followed by good days. It’s simply the cycle and movement of life. Abuse, addiction and adultery certainly are qualifiers for harm but all the rest is largely work throughable, may we all be so fortunate as to find a human in which we can work things through with.",
            "Maybe Geri (Ginger?). Idk about that one!",
            "Fair point, I take that one back. I will still stand on that even if he cheated with legal and consensual people and she forgave him then she will have had her reasons and that there is still a real possibilty that they weren't monogamous at that point or ever",
            "She went full terf apparently https://www.clashmusic.com/features/of-course-geri-halliwell-is-a-tory-shes-been-telling-us-that-for-years/",
            "She would have had her reasons for staying with him but you can apply that to any unhappy relationship ever. There’s plenty of people in unhappy relationships  they all have their reasons for staying in them. Often simply fear of being alone.",

Not that I have anything against women, but why do I have to do that? Why can’t I have Marvels that are both? Why do I need an all-Black cast?”\n\nYep, that's about what I expected from a Perlmutter crony. Morally wrong AND practically wrong; Black Panther made $2 billion.

            "To clarify, it's more about such desires being insatiable.  Most people, for example, have a number that they want to hit for retirement, e.g., \"I want to have X dollars available to retire off,\" and when they hit it, they're satiated.  Greed, by its very definition, is never satisfied.  For some people, they get a taste of what it's like to have wealth and power and they are consumed by wanting more, but when they get more, it's never quite as good as the first time, and it's never enough.  It's like an addict that is always chasing that first high.\n\nFor example, if I had 3 million dollars in my retirement account, I'd quit work tomorrow and retire. Instead of trying to make that into 50 million or 500 million, I would spend my time doing the things I love to do, with the knowledge that I don't have to worry about money. However for someone to become a billionaire, they only way that's possible, besides inheritance or winning the lottery, is because the only thing that they want to do is make more money.\n\nIt's the same with power... most well-adjusted people do not want to rule the world and do not want to forcibly change the entire world to fit what they want, partially because it just sounds exhausting, but mostly because they recognize that other people have minds of their own and wills of their own, and that in order to attempt to mold the world to fit one's own view of what it should be like, a lot of innocent people would be hurt in the process, and people with a basic moral compass and the ability to feel empathy find that idea abhorrent.  That's not to say that most people don't want a certain level of freedom to do what they want, but typically people realize that their freedom to swing their fists around stops at their fellow human's face. To become a billionaire, you have to believe that you have the right to swing your fist and hit someone's face (metaphorically) because either you're better or stronger or more deserving than the other person.  You can't truly desire to rule the world unless you believe deep down that there are a lot of people who don't deserve to be treated as people because of some warped view of morality.",

Or.. maybe I wouldn't. Maybe after a few years I *would* get bored. \n\nI guess the thing is for every billionaire out there working until they drop we don't hear about the dozens of people people who hit it big and just go live life doing whatever for 50 years then die. Like MySpace Tom.. sold the platform for half a billion then fucked off to do amateur photography (which is super professional, he just doesn't sell it) and travel the world.

BP was alright, BP2 was overhyped and I would wager the bulk of its box office numbers are due more to loyalty watches than it just being a good movie in general.\n\nWhat do I mean by “loyalty watches”? Well, in my hometown, there were multiple social groups centered around black heritage that made going to see the Black Panther premier a whole event big enough for them to rent out an entire theater just for their group, those same groups did the exact same thing for BP2, understandably. There was the same thing at my college when BP released, probably the same for BP2. I work for a property developer, some of our properties had similar groups that hosted big screening events for BP2. And I could spend an entire thread talking about the various black-centered social groups littered throughout LA that made events out of these movies premiering. \n\nMy point being, a whole lot of the viewers for those movies went to see them more out of social obligation to support their people in Hollywood, than the movie itself being really good. That’s not to say that it’s a problem, I actually admire that action; it just explains how such subpar content generated so much buzz and popularity for Marvel. Also, I want to say that I don’t hate either movie; I personally enjoyed the first more than Wakanda Forever, but I overall liked both movies. I just don’t think they’re anywhere near the level the industry often tries to prop them up to. Like, BP getting a best picture nomination is a near-comedic level of ridiculousness, let’s be real here.",

So there were always going to be some concessions. Another thing we need to be honest about. 2010s Hollywood was not going to spend 150 million on a movie without any white faces. It's dumb, it's bullshit, it's Hollywood being racist but it's true. It wasn't going to happen without some casting changes.\n\nAnyway, there is a slew of things you can blame M. Night for.

It said that Starship Troopers is satire, but it can also be viewed as legitimately a fascist/military film. That's because Starship Troopers doesn't just show the fascist military as bad and/or stupid, but as cool, powerful, and heroic. \n\nYou have highly attractive and charismatic characters gunning down ugly, viscous bugs. It's a film that makes the viewer want to cheer on the fascists.\n\nStarship Troopers shows you a fascist futuristic society and it doesn't tell you if it's good or bad. It just is. So many movies nowadays, especially those with a political message, are always trying to tell the viewer what they should be thinking. \n\nIt's what makes the movie interesting and unique in the film industry. It's also why you'll likely not see a movie like Starship Troopers again anytime soon. To many writers are too obsessed with making sure the audience \"gets it\" and therefore would be reluctant to show the fascists in any positive light. \n\nIt's like how in Black Panther you had that scene where Killmonger randomly chokes out that older woman because he didn't like her opinion. Can't have the audience being TOO sympathetic with the charismatic fascist. Need to really emphasize how bad he is by giving him a kick the dog moment.",

So instead they started giving big reveals much earlier and trying to keep audiences on their toes.\n\nThat's a long-winded way to say I think part of the issue is Marvel doesn't want to take any risks right now, they want a lot of stories but they won't let any of them go anywhere.  Maybe I'm wrong, but that's how it seems.  No risk taking, individual movies only move the larger universe in small increments, at best you get a hint of something happening in another story just to make you feel like properties are connected.\n\nMost audiences aren't going to watch your TV show if they think it doesn't matter, and they're not going to sit through 20 more movies while you ploddingly find your way.",

Having impossible guidelines, more bureaucracy to navigate (because you absolutely have to increase the amount of people working for you to make it work at that scale), and taxing your entire team with  double or triple the amount of work is not a recipe for success. Maybe good for the corporate numbers in the short term, but you give up a lot of ground long term. If Feige was allowed to scale properly. I think they would be in a good place. They were doing just fine with 3 movies and 1-2 TV series a year.

Storytelling can definitely have surprise and suspense, even in episodic formats. Anime does it fairly well. The Last of Us kept people on the edge of their seats, despite the show being a very faithful adaptation of the game. No One Will Save You was a fantastic recent film that kept people surprised despite having virtually zero dialogue. \n\nGood storytelling will show through in a production.

I think this is the first thought everyone had when Kang was introduced.     \nThere's a resolution problem with heroes and villains and their story not ending.  Iron Man's story line is a great example of how to end a story but then you've ended the character.  The multi-universe thing that has always existed in comics which gives new writers an out to bring back dead/popular characters, but adopting this to big budget films is not going to go over so well the way people put up with it in comics.  Comics have been doing this since the 1960's with their silver age hero characters, but we haven't had to resolve this problem yet in billion dollar films.

But then you've only got like 9 or 10 films, which feels really empty because the events of a given movie generally don't span a very long time in-universe unless you have clunky time skips breaking up the flow. You've either got only a handful of sparse events leaving you to wonder \"wait, what the fuck has batman been up to the rest of the year?\" between instances of big Batman action, or you skip a lot of the big Batman action. Either way a binge watch of it will probably feel like \"wait, why did split off so soon?\"\n\nOr you can do a TV series where you can pass the universe-time at the same rate as production time, but tell more story with more screen time. S1 of *Loki* had 280 minutes of screen time to develop its characters and tell a story. That's at least 2 movies to reach the same screen time, which means at least 2 years IRL, and the pacing will feel all kinds of whack. There's like 50% more screen time in *Agents of SHIELD* alone than there is from *Iron Man* to *Endgame*. Give us prestige series with movies for the really big events. Introduce Batman in a movie, followed by then a 6-13 episode season of prestige series with a villain of the week/fortnight, Bruce adopts Dick Grayson in the sequel film, he gets a season or two, becomes Nightwing in the next movie, etc. It just makes so much more sense as a format for such a massive universe",
            "Black widow also hurt by coming out AFTER we know her fate. \n\nIf it had come out between infinity war and endgame I think it would have been great. It was neat learning about her past but it was also kinda like \"why should I care I know what happens.\"",
            "She-Hulk was presented as being a workplace sitcom, which is a form of television that inherently spends a long time maintaining the status quo without much forward progression. And that's perfectly fine, as long as you make the comedy *funny*!\n\nThe issue was that this was a sitcom that seemed to ignore the lessons that were perfected decades ago about how to structure a good self-contained sitcom episode. Worse, it was a workplace sitcom in which none of the main character's work colleagues were distinctive or funny. It had funny side-characters (Madisynn; the new, pacifist version of Abomination), but they weren't part of the recurring cast.\n\nIt's telling that everyone's favourite episodes were the one where Wong turned up, the one where Daredevil turned up, and the final episode that finally went for broke with the metafictional stuff.",
            "> It was weird to come out of that movie and be like, \"That movie kinda sucked, but I really miss Chadwick Boseman.\"\n\nEvery day fam. Especially since I actually enjoyed the twist they had on Namor, and would loved to have seen them actually duel it out rather than all the other stuff they added to compensate (Ironheart, weird mermaid costume from Wakanda, etc).",
            "This is a major factor that I don't see taken into consideration enough. \n\nIt wasn't the best movie but imagine how much better it could have been if they could have had the three leads doing the usual circuit of YouTube interviews and late night shows. \n\nIman Vellani's enthusiasm alone would have sold some more tickets.",
            "All fair points, though I really liked both WandaVision and Ms Marvel (and the Captain Marvel movie). Secret Invasion… uh… exists. For some reason. \n\nI think Marvel bungled the timing. If they released The Marvels much earlier, it could have ridden on the hype from their Disney+ shows, now it arrived so late that even people who liked those were like ”wait, who are these characters again?” (Also a common problem from all their other shows and movies lately. ”Hey, remember this cool character we introduced three years ago and are now randomly bringing back?” ”Uh, no?”)",
            "Some executive on that movie really wanted to validate their relationship",
            "Or it would have except the screenwriters interpreted the law incorrectly...the relationship in that movie is 100% illegal in reality.",
            "I genuinely don’t lol And thank fucking god",
            "That's what killed the 24 episode season. People no longer were willing to accept filler (good, most filler sucks), but the writers couldn't keep up with that.\n\nSo a lower episode count per season came in to compensate.",
            "As compared to the bloated whale-corpse of a budget it had, there's not enough Vellani enthusiasm to sell enough tickets.",
            "But its not just that, its that the *hype from a streaming show* is substantially smaller than people outside of the fandom appreciate. \n\nThe thing that Disney is slowly learning is that their overgeneration of content has led to a place where nobody gives a shit anymore. \n\nIn phases 1-3 you had a small, handful of characters to care about, and only 5 Avengers. Now... the list is so large that nobody knows and only a few diehards actually care about. Shit on Disney+ is not bringing people to the theaters. Its an altogether worse decision to try and make those characters a centerpiece of their film universe.",

Her mum was a hairdresser and her dad was an electronic engineer. He eventually started some sort of electronic part wholesaler which meant that they were well off but she wasn’t that way her whole life. When he came into money he bought an old second hand RR and he used to drop her off to school in it. Bc she lived and went to school in a working class area, getting dropped off in an RR led to her being bullied and excluded  for others thinking that she thought she was better than everyone else. She used to beg her dad to drop her to school in the work van. This is the lore of “POSH” spice because everyone used to call her posh. But in the UK class is much more than income.

            "I'm gonna try to do a \"\"\"quick\"\"\" rundown but I will leave a tl dr here at the start because I'm probably going to end up dumping a wall of text.\n\nTldr: Liberal president is elected by a small margin, people had too many expectation from such government.\n\nSome context: primaries in Argentina are not done by the parties themselves, instead we do a \"mock\" election where parties can fill more than one candidate for one position and the one that gets the most votes is the one that actually becomes the candidate in the \"real\" election.\n\nMacri is the founder of PRO, a liberal-conservative party, think of the Republican Party before they went insane. In 2015 they made an alliance with the historic UCR party which depending on which faction is in control is either a social-liberal/soc dem party, and CC ARI which is a christian-democracy party.\n\nIn the election Macri wins the primaries with 24% of the votes (his coalition gathering a total of 30%). That 24% (where I'm included) represents the \"OG\" Macri vote, aka, the people that chose Macri and his economic liberalism as their first choice. In the real election he comes in second and manages to keep the votes of his coalition allies and gains an extra 4% (mainly from older people that usually don't bother to vote in the primaries).\n\nThe other 2 candidates, Scioli which represented the kirchnerists came in first with 37% of the vote, and Massa, an ex kirchnerist representing peronists that don't like the kirchners got 21%. Since no candidate met the criteria to win in the 1st round it means that we went to a 2nd round, with both peronists candidates having the clear majority of the votes (58%).\n\nIn the 2nd round Macri wins against Scioli by 3 points, a bigger part of Massa's electorate broke in favor of Macri.\n\nSo after 12 years of kirchnerism, we have a new party in power, so kirchnerists are gone, right? Well, out of the 24 provinces, Macri's alliance only controlled 4, in the House they were the first plurality 86/257 members, but mainly thanks to the peronists having splintered into 2 groups, peronists still made a majority of the house.  In the senate it was even worse, they only had 17 out of 72, with the kirchnerists having a majority of 39. And this is only speaking of institutional power, the peronists control groups of people that protests and break shit if the government doesn't give them money, on top of also controlling most if not all of the unions that casually start demanding more than usual when the peronists are not in power.\n\nSo you have a weak government that is tasked with controlling inflation, get out of default, cut down public spending, restarting an economy that hasn't really grown in the last 5 years, and all of that without pissing off around 40% of the people that made you president.\n\nIn the first 2 years his government was slow, with the most notorious thing being that we came out of default and we started adjusting the price of things like public transportation, electricity and gas that were all heavily subsidized, but all of this was done without lowering spending too much because the government was too weak and taking loans to cover the deficit.\n\nAfter the mid term elections they managed to become the first plurality in both chambers of congress (if you don't combine the peronists blocks). The first important legislation he passed was a new formula on how to calculate pensions. Until then pensions were calculated with 30% inflation +70% revenue, Argentina at this point has a chronic inflation problem and old people suffer this the most because the formula doesn't take inflation that much into account, so they inverted the numbers, 70% will come from inflation, 30% from revenue.\n\nLeftists groups (the kirchnerists and the marxists parties) took this as a brutal advance against pensioners, and attacked congress with rocks while they were discussing the law. This reminded everyone that even if the kirchnerists didn't represent a majority of the people anymore they were violent enough to matter.\n\nRemember how the deficit was not being lowered that much and we were covering it with debt? Well, at the start of 2018 we had a hike on interests rates so financing this slow adjustment of public spending stopped being viable, so we went and made a deal with the evil and spooky IMF. The IMF gave us cheap loans in exchange of actually having to adjust spending at a decent speed.\n\nWhile all of this was happening the way our central bank was somewhat keeping inflation under control kept getting more and more expensive because starting from Dec 16, 2015 the US Federal Reserve started raising their interests rate. For some context the Fed's interests rate was completely frozen from 2008 until 2015, so it was super unprecedented. \n\nThe basic idea is: the central bank would issue a series of short term bonds that were meant to encourage people to stay in ARS instead of changing them to USD, but with the Fed raising interests rates it kept getting more and more difficulted. [Like holy hell, look at this, I'm not saying there was a conspiracy or something but Macri just got really unlucky.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds_rate#Rates_since_2008_global_economic_downturn)\n\nFor the rest of his government it was a grind of trying to stay on program with the IMF while preventing the streets from erupting in flames. In 2019 it's time for elections, the program the government did these last 2 years was working pretty good, we were almost at 0 deficit for that year, and inflation while still bad in the yearly rate came under control in the monthly rates. BUT, this was done by lowering subsidies on electricity and gas, which people LOVED. So effects of the responsible macro policy were not being felt by the population yet, and Macri was even facing internal opposition for these policies from the soc dem part of his alliance.\n\n[I know things look scary right now but, it's gonna get way worse.] (https://www.youtube.com/shorts/BVueEr6GnHI) Remember how peronists were still the majority but they were splitted into 2 groups that hated each other? Well, they reconciled and made a united peronist front and the rest is history.",

            "Damn, some random guy on the internet just told me to learn other languages, whatever will I do now?\n\nI know different people speak different languages, thanks. Here's what the difference is. By the time football was invented, all languages around the world were already more or less well established (since it was around the second half of the 19th century). So they basically learned about the concept of football and then decided to name it something different for no reason whatsoever.\n\nImagine we had our fully formed modern version of English, but then we discovered sushi for the first time. Then we took the concept of sushi and came up with a completely new word for it for no reason. That's basically what soccer is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: for the record I lived in Spain for 4 years, and nobody calls it fucking balonpie in Spanish or Catalan or Basque.

            "Really? For me it’s the opposite, I think Kylie is starting to look like Kendall lol. They are basically morphing into each other, maybe same surgeons?",

            "> she looked exactly like grumpy cat.\n\nAubrey Plaza would like a word.",
            "Her career has been middling at best, though. She's very attractive, but she's really just an okay model. She's (generously) a pretty mediocre actress. She doesn't seem particularly charismatic in interviews. Like, I get that when you work in hollywood you make famous friends, but as you point out nobody else has THIS MANY super famous friends, which goes back to my point about how she must be the most fun guest in the history of everything. She's EVERYWHERE. She was on that big February cover of British Vogue with, like, Oprah and Serena Williams and Cindy Crawford, for fuck's sake. She leads a truly WILD existence.\n\nI don't dislike her or begrudge her her life, quite the opposite. I'm fucking fascinated. I want someone to follow her around for a year as she tries to decide which invitations to accept (out of ALL OF THEM). I want to understand. In the meantime, failing that, I will continue to be utterly delighted at the fact that she shows up in the most colossally random places.",

            "She looks great, but as a reminder to myself too - it's best not to compare ourselves, especially not to the uber rich and famous. I remember asking my drama teacher if I was as pretty as some movie star, and he told me \"let's get you the same hair team, makeup team, lighting, and trainers and then we can make a fair comparison.\" I didn't like the answer at the time, but in hindsight it really helps me.\n\nSorry if that was too preachy, I'm j/s there's no comparing when you've got a whole beauty team and brands will even send you their best products for free, haha",
            "I didn’t realize that, good for her honestly",
            "So many undeserving people were on that cover. Acting like only people on Oprah and Serena’s level were on it is insane. Is not shocking she was there. \n\nShe’s probably nice. As many celebrities friends of hers have said it.\n\nAnd a lot of people have super famous friends. Look at Derek Blasberg, he works on fashion and is friends with multiple A listers and the wealthiest socialites in NY.",

            "Your boobs are gorgeous (I have never seen them I just appreciate the human form and your breasts are part of your beautiful body!!!)",
            "No you don't sound preachy to me. It's nice to be reminded of that. I think we must be around the same age and if that's the case then I know you remember the diet culture we grew up in. I remember hearing Hillary Duff was fat as a tween and thinking that I was too. I remember how every commercial was lite or zero carb diet foods that had all nutritional value taken out of them. It was awful. I got an eating disorder at age 11 and got treatment at age 20 in 2013. Thank God I did. My life without bulimia is so much better. But I remember how we couldn't watch TV while I was in treatment because of the commercials. So they normally screened movies and then let us watch those. Well someone didn't screen the movie we got once and it was a disaster, funny in retrospect. They got Pitch Perfect and to our surprise a full on projectile vomiting scene came on. It upset a lot of us who had been being heavily sheltered from images like that for the months long stays. It's wild how it's everywhere. I see this generation hyperfixating on skincare and that's great but it does lead some to think perfect skin is just about routine. Like being overweight having acne can be totally out of our control. Yes it's good to be conscious of what we use on our bodies and what we out into it but we can forget about the many genetic factors and illnesses that can result in acne or being overweight. I don't have kids so I hope parents and teachers are remembering to keep that in mind.",
            "Tell me why my brothers are older but their girlfriends act the same…\n\nAnyway makes total sense, I read it as if your brothers beat your husband up you’d drop a dime on them 😭",
            "Very astute of you, we're same gen for sure.. I remember allll of that. The magazines, how they treated Hillary Duff, how they treated Britney Spears when she performed Gimme More at the VMAs. I'm so sorry to hear about your suffering, especially since back then most people's response to eating disorders was \"JuSt EaT a SaNdWhIcH!!1!\" But you had to be so strong to overcome that, and I wish those same people understood what that takes. The fact diet culture's messaging was so strong they actually screened all media during treatment is mind blowing... I always thought I was fat from that messaging too, at 5'5\"-6\" and 135 lbs... (and the fact that my high school boyfriend bought into it wholesale and regurgitated it back to me didn't help), but my ED didn't surface until right after high school. My mom got me a trainer at LA Fitness thinking it'd help me feel better, but instead it turned into me purging by over-exercising and restricting my calories to only \"1200\" a day (though I always over-estimated so it was likely even less), I refused to ever sit, I'd park in the back of a parking lot and RUN to the store when I went shopping, I ate the same strictly regimented things at the same time every day until you could literally see every bone in my body, even my sternum without breathing in, and my period completely went away. It was at this point I started running into this creepy guy in a local bookstore (I'd go and read baking recipes which I'd then make for others and eat none of myself), and one of the times he approached me he complimented my body and asked how I stay in \"such great shape.\" Even then I was appalled. But I didn't get better until the nutritionist I was VERY lucky to have, told me that if I didn't stop what I was doing, my heart was either going to stop, or explode. And recovery was still a long, painful road.\n\nIt's a great insight that skincare is the new gen's version of weight loss for us, and while I don't have kids either, I find it kind of bittersweet... I'm glad that the new fixation is less of an immediate health risk, but also sad that it's just a different iteration of the same thing all over again - an obsession with the only two things we're told by mass media make us \"worthy\", youth and beauty. This is even highlighted by the \"clean girl\" trend, it's right out in the open that you're expected to look \"naturally beautiful\" and showing that it's still a trick but even then it's still the unobtainable dream that girls actively pursue... I suspect it's the same struggle our parents had, because no matter how many times you're told that media is an illusion, the messaging burrows deeper than that. It sucks, to say the least. But we came out of it, with scars but we did it... so these girls will be okay too, and they're at least more media savvy than we were, so hopefully the cuts aren't as deep and the trend keeps going until we're just clear of shit like this altogether.\n\nIf you happen to still be here after that novel, though... I'm glad you made it through and that you made it out on top. 11-20 is a long time, and I know that battle wasn't easy. I can't imagine what it really took. But I know it means you're awesome, and I'm happy you're here.",
            "What a beautiful thing for you to be vulnerable and share your story to help another stranger feel seen. Thank you for giving me that gift. Your words of encouragement are powerful and really made me look back at myself with pride for my strength. Thank you for pointing it out so I could see that too. \n\nYou put yourself through torture to try to make yourself what society wanted. I am sorry that you had to endure that and society's horrible attitude towards our struggle. Your journey sounds really painful but impactful. I am glad that you made it out to see the otherside. I hope that's not a demons you're still actively trying to outrun. I know how hard it is to fully shake that off. You've got a friend in me if you ever need someone else to listen or give advice where I can. You must so possess that strength you're complimenting me on for overcoming it yourself! Hope you are proud too\n\nThe hoops we make women jump through to feel like they're beautiful is dumbfounding. I felt sad for the girls in this generation because I'm sure the body dysmoprhianis extremely strong with the use of filters being so prevelant. I know I got burnt out of my beauty routine because it felt like a chore. The getting up hours before work to do my hair and makeup as if I was working in media was ridiculous. The fun of makeup artistry and self care is taken out when it's just a prerequisite to be apart of society. The questions i would get from work when i didnt do my routine were absurd. My male boss even sent me home a couple of times, from a job where I chased around 5-9 olds all day in summer art school, because I looked like I was sick and going to pass out. Bitch please.  Rupauls right when she said we're all born naked and the rest is drag."

In fact, the Sunday Times reports, Beckham stayed in favour at his home ground from the moment he set foot back there.\n\nUnited fans rallied around Beckham in the face of the fans of other clubs singling him out.

After watching this doc, I honestly thought she was great. It was totally endearing how they met and how they tried to see each other and be together as much as possible. And she was so frank and genuine about their relationship. It made me want to hang out with her and have a beer.",

            "Eva's dress is one of the best dresses from the event I've seen, hands down. It's such a lovely blue and it's draped to perfection. The length is great, the shape is great, and it moves really well with her body.",
            "I liked Kerry's.",
            "Maren looks terrible sorry.\n\n\nOlitz ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ Kerry looks like perfection",
            "It’s not as hideous as the dress Elizabeth Banks was wearing a while back but these…bedazzlements? David Koma keeps using are very confusing to me. \n\nMaybe he ordered too many and they’re not the size he was expecting? LOL",
            "I love Kerry’s style but",
            "Is Kerry’s hand crocheted??",
            "I love the mini Kamala suit on Amara, her great niece.",
            "Maren Morris dress is ugly as fuck. What are those stones... Looks cheap, honestly",
            "Looks like the midi is back!",
            "Wow Eva and Kerry look amazing!!!",
            "I love Kerry’s outfit! Adorable!",
            "Kerry is so beautiful. And love the white dress!! That length can be tricky but it looks perfect on her",
            "The little suit is giving such big energy. I see someone has a role model :)",
            "The only outfit I liked was Kerry Washington’s outfit.",
            "Olivia and Fitz are looking cute lol\n\nSeriously though, almost all Kerry Washington’s outfits on that show were 👩🏻‍🍳💋👌",
            "That's a stunning shade of blue. I'm glad to see other colors (I know, I know, suffragist white)\n\nI was not prepared to see Olivia Pope and President Grant 🤣 but I love it.",
            "I like Eva and Kerry's clothes. Perfection. \n\nI don't love Maren's outfit, namely the jacket.",
            "Yeah, I hate it. It looks like the losing designers look on an episode of Project Runway.",
            "I don’t think going shirtless under a blazer is appropriate for this event.",
            "Guess I’m an old but this is the DNC. Please at least wear a silk tank or something under your jacket.",
            "The whole thing is a mess. The blazer looks too small. I know it’s intentional but it looks ridiculous IMO.",
            "It made me think of football players when they take their pads out 😬",
            "The drop waist on that dress combined with all the extra material makes the dress look ill fitting, even though it seems to be properly fitted! Something about the neckline also makes the dress look cheap. \n\nI’m kind of surprised because VB is the queen of petite-friendly outfits!",
            "Had the exact same thought: too much material for a petite woman.\n\nThe high ponytail and overall lack of jewelry give the vibe that someone else was supposed to speak and they just grabbed Eva from the audience and threw an available dress at her backstage right before she went on. \n\nHer styling is great more often than not so this one is puzzling to me.",
            "I think people point this out because of the proportions. The human brain is extremely good at pattern recognition, and when things are visually proportional the average brain finds it more pleasing. \n\nCertainly this type of critique can come from a fatphobic mindset (one where clothes must always be \"flattering\"), but a lot of times it's just because many of us see something that appears out of proportion (out of pattern), and we want to fix it. \n\nSo, I think it's less to do with the notion that someone who is short shouldn't look short (though that can definitely be a factor), and more to do with the way the look is disproportional.",
            "Yeah, feels like a PR miss to bring them both and not have her in a boss bitch coat. Or a huge bag and a wine glass",
            "It looks too casual for an evening event!",
            "A \"tea cosy\" is wild 💀",
            "Hard disagree about the draping. The gathered dart at the front of the dress looks like it’s hitting right at her vag. The skirt moves and gathers in a funky way around her hips and thighs as a result. \n\nThinking about this designed for an average height woman (or taller - Eva is famously very petite), the dart should probably hit more between the wearer’s belly button and hip bones on the lower waist, not below the bum, though. \n\nShe’s worn some dresses that really flatter her height and are well tailored for her. In this case, that beautiful blue saves the styling.",
            "yes I think all crochet is hand made, there are no machines that can crochet?",
            "It gets [worse!](https://www.reddit.com/r/whatthefrockk/s/pkBjTe8dxB)",
            "That is half the reason I watched that show. Impeccable wardrobe!",
            "Yes, the jacket is the worst IMO. It looks like a Forever 21 outfit I bought in high school.",
            "Ouf 🫠 not wrong tho",
            "Agree with everything you say. Great catch on the dropped waist. I didn’t see it but now I can’t unseen it. VB should have done better by her bestie!",
            "Eva isn’t just petite though, she’s pretty curvy petite. This dress does not flatter her shape at all.",
            "You’re assuming every brain is the same and has had the same visual input. “Pleasing” proportions to you may not be the same to everyone else. At the very least it’s coming from a fashion assimilationist point of view…which I actively work against. To look at something and instantly find it “offensive” (using that term literally) without further exploration is a tragedy to me when it comes to fashion. That’s what makes people look at avant garde fashion and disregard it without a moment to learn about it\n\nALSO, if you want to just say “our brains want to see the same thing over and over”, how would fashion evolve at all? The people who challenge these “norms” are the drivers of the industry.\n\nI understand that you may not like how this fits her, but justifying it as natural “brain” function is just strange. It’s ok that you don’t like it.",
            "I actually went and did a Google search for some of her Olivia Pope “boss bitch coats” as an example (but there were too many knockout gorgeous looks) damn … every outfit was such a serve",
            "I can't describe the face I just made",
            "I explicitly never said every brain is the same. I used words like \"average\", \"most\", and \"a lot\". \n\nI also never said or implied that we want to see the same things over and over. That's really reductive of human pattern recognition. \n\nI also never said I don't like it. I'm offering an explanation of why a garment that is disproportionate on a body may not look pleasing to many people.",
            "She had the freaking best fashion for professional ladies to aspire to",
            "You tried to justify preference with a generalization about pattern recognition. It’s just personal preference and “trend”. It’s not deeper than that.\n\nPeople don’t like it because they’re told not to like it. Media tries to make “rules” and people buy them without question. \n\nAt the end of the day, it’s still personal preference.",
            "Ok 👍"

            "She has no idea of how to navigate either friends, acquaintances or business relationships. Everything is so transactional with her. I couldn’t imagine wanting someone like her in my life. Always hustling, always scheming. She must be exhausting to be around, not to mention, never satisfied and therefore, never happy. No wonder she has her screaming fits.",
            "This proves how toxic she is.",
            "Am I crazy or hasn’t this and a lot more of the story already been told? Wasn’t there a pre wedding back story about M borrowing their LA home and private jet? And expecting free VB clothes? And an accusation that Posh had “leaked” details about M? A phone call with David and Harry about leaking? And then the invictus snub?   \n\nSomeone help me out here, I can’t have imagined all this 😂",
            "Rachel wishes she could be Posh, but her hubby is a few tiers lower than David on the social pecking order. \n\nI live in the states and soccer is huge where I live. If David randomly showed up, he’d get mobbed. If Sparry showed up without much PR, I doubt few people would know who he is. \n\nRachel would fuck up a free lunch",
            "I doubt Victoria would have ever become Meghan's friend. She's friends with Kate and William so I don't think it would have happened. But this just tells you how entitled Meghan thinks she is when she feels she has power. \n\nAt this point I wonder how Harry can keep up straight considering he has no spine. He really is a medical marvel.\nWhat a turn off when a guy lets his wife decide who to hang out with. What a shame.",
            "If this is true, Meghan Markle *really* doesn't know what she is doing. On a friendship level, its awful.....but I don't get it on a image/brand level. Who has done it better than the Beckhams? Who wouldn't want to be photographed hanging out with them? There is no doubt they have made huge marks in the worlds of fashion, sports, music and philanthropy in the UK, the Commonwealth, the United States, and beyond!. Being seen with them is a *thing*.\n\nI have a theory that when David Beckham knew he wanted to do a docu-series type of show, he did it at Netflix on purpose, he knew he and his wife could churn out a show that would far surpass anything Harry had done in awards and viewership. I think the Netflix show the Beckhams did, which was undeniably a HUGE success in every way, (they even got a Super bowl ad out of it!!!!) was Beckhams eff you to Harry. This is David Beckham after all, super competitive, and he likes to 'win' and he is a staunch monarchist. \n\nAs for Harry and Meghan, this story really goes against Meghan's thirsty-at-all-costs image. Did she not understand how huge this couple is on a world stage? To have David Beckham support an Invictus Game would be a major coup. It doesn't make sense.\n\n(just an aside, as for Posh looking stony-faced, thats her look!)",
            "Meanwhile the Beckhams are living their best lives, producing, creating, donating, helping and making it work. Sure, they have a slick PR image, but no doubt they have a close family life & same close friends & advisors since the very early days. Like 25 yrs same teams working w them.\nThe Carparkles tho, every single utterance is for Backgrid, no substance, no content, no creation just a lot of talk. Selling out the family is their only business. Their team changes so quickly & frequently that they probably don't even know who works for them",
            "Wanting to power play one of the most famous couple out there never ends well.",
            "Harry is an adult. Yes she is toxic and did her little thing she always does but Harry is an adult. I am sure she tried to get rid of Nacho too and yet she hasn't managed. It is up to Harry to maintain or not his friendships not Meghan's. It is up to Harry to give her boundaries in regards to his friendships.",
            "Harry and Meghan were a BIG mistake … ",
            "It’s interesting that we have so much information about the Harkle-Beckham history. The vast majority of it is probably leaked by Meghan, but I think the Beckhams have clapped back a bit - and who can blame them? \n\nWhat *I’m* interested in is the Clooneys. They were variously connected in those early days.  That’s a post for another day.",
            "This is all just so stupid that I want to call BS on it but…so many other stupid rumors have been confirmed - so I guess I believe it.\n\n\nI just can’t understand the planet M is living on where she moved to another country and didn’t think she needed to spend any time making any allies. Everyone at the place hated her, the Beckham were quickly offended, all of Wimbledon was told to steer clear of her empty box. I just don’t get it.\n\n\nI know the answer is that she was/is on a power trip but…it’s so dumb.",
            "![gif](giphy|AgPt9udT567spxbSHf)\n\nNot surprised at all! Who wouldnt want Posh and Becks around? And Dimwit is an idiot if he knew MM did this and still supports her. MM acts like a mean highschooler.",
            "This wedding was a disaster within and outside of the family.\n\nThe royal family let these two run wild, it is no wonder they came in like cyclones and hurt everyone in their path?  Who was going to stop them?",
            "Remember that awkward photo opposite Sydney Harbour Bridge when Harry and the Aussie Representatives were huddled together, and Meghan was stood alone?",
            "Harry is not allowed friendships that are not facilitated through Meghan.",
            "Bower evidently dislikes Meghan just a bit more than he dislikes the Beckhams. Because I read that book and he claims David is a serial cheater and all he and Victoria care about is their brand. Their marriage is a sham and their children talentless nepobabies. I quite enjoyed the Beckham documentary and became their fan so I was disappointed by how Bower portrayed them as stupid, greedy and selfish with no redeeming qualities whatsoever.",
            "She might have masterminded this but...HE WENT WITH IT! Where was his loyalty to old friends?\n\nI really get the feeling there's a divorce on the way and we're being \"briefed on which side to take\".\n\nThey're equally culpable.\n\nPlease, don't fall for this BS.",
            "Haha what? Why?? would Meghan veto the Beckhams?? They’re a total power couple, A+ list. Everybody likes them, on both sides of the pond. Why choose to alienate them, while sucking up to the likes of Oprah? \n\nI trust Tom Bower. He does his research and he never gets sued or has to retract. So I believe that these things happened. \n\nI just don’t understand the motivation!! Meghan is soooo bad at this. Barking up the wrong tree, every single time. ",
            "Tell us something we \\_didn't\\_ know...",
            "She was so high on narc supply around the time of the wedding. All the publicity, praise and adoration went to her head in a very big way.",
            "Haha she tries to take on bigger targets than she can handle. The Beckhams,  the RF, Paltrow et al. She is a human Wile E. Coyote with the same success rate.",
            "All narcs are like this, had a “friend” in high school who was always scheming what to do and get from other  people, she was always plotting and wanted me to help her and it was just exhausting to hear her talk ALL THE TIME, she was just like Megs, a lover of her own voice.",
            "She’s a narcissistic psychopath",
            "No, this story was making the rounds a while back, and the Beckhams did appear to speak, confirming the feud, via their sources.",
            "David just bought a team in Miami and California has a big team. Even Patrick Mahomes wife was a female player on a minor international team. With the U.S. hosting the World Cup you’d think she’d play it smart and get archwell to sponsor but as always she never looks too far ahead. Every important billionaire and eligible athlete will be at the games. So will Kim kardashian looking for husband 4 if she doesn’t go down with diddy. Roach will not get an invite. Meanwhile William will probably go to Canada with the kids to cheer on England. ",
            "Her husband is way lower than david no only on social pecking orders but in intelligence, charisma,  charm, talent, good looks and the fact that he actually is a hard worker.",
            "That’s certainly true now about the pecking order, but back in 2018, Harry and Meghan’s stars were as high as they would ever go. They were the hot new working royals. An invitation to their wedding was a big deal. \n\nIt’s so mind boggling how far below they are now. ",
            "Probably why she didn’t invite them to the wedding dinner.  She’s hyper competitive with Catherine, and the idea of the Beckhams hanging with the Prince & Princess of Wales (then Duke & Duchess of Cambridge) made her gag with envy.",
            "David was apparently one of the few people Harry would've listened to (like William, Catherine, and \"Skippy\" Inskip) so she had to sever those relationships quickly to guarantee the ring on her finger.",
            "Meghan because a member of the RF, and lost all sense and didn’t  know how to act. She also clearly doesn’t know how to play the long game. That’s why she bungled the Beckham connection and the connection to the RF. The moment she thinks she has power over you or a situation she goes scorched earth.\n\nShe likely thought the Beckhams were below her, and would always be looking to use her and her new connections. Unlike her and Harry, the Beckhams can stand on their own in Hollywood, the UK, Fashion and sporting world.",
            "And I am sure Meg was incandescent with rage after Beckham won an Emmy that she wasn't even nominated for.",
            "For all of Meghan’s thinking that she belongs with the big players, this behaviour shows she is not. Big stars always align with big stars. They know how the gig works. That is why agencies like WME have famous names appearing together at functions. Stronger together, even if you don’t like each other.",
            "Yes, he reported on this when he did the book on Meghan. David flew half way around the globe as a favor to harry, and then they refused to meet him. M also offended them when she claimed (with no evidence as per) that Posh had leaked a story about them.\n\n\nTakes aways from the credibility of their claim that William leaked about them. I hate that they make themselves authorities on everything when they are so full of shit. Like, even if they aren't actually trying to lie sometimes they still have no reasoning skills or sense.",
            "At the time, she must have been so high on her sense of power, moving everyone around like pieces on her little wedding invite chessboard.",
            "Meghan must have been seething with envy and hatred, determined to soar above them and instead landed with a thump far below. The ones she chases - Ellen, Oprah, TP - are going through rough patches now. The Beckhams have had some controversies of their own, but always get through. \n\nI remember Meghan endlessly going on in interviews about Ellen telling her to get a shelter dog (Bogart, who she Markled because he didn't like Harry) and Ellen making public her wish for a wedding invitation, which she didn't get. So she got Meghan back with all those \"jokes\" on her show.",
            "She has a huge inferiority complex.",
            "She does whatever her out of control anger and entitlement lead her to do.  Good thing she has a Royal useful idiot to give her a platform.",
            "The Beckhams are also incredibly close to each of their own families. This makes a huge difference too as they're not just surrounded by yes people. Meghan and Harry can both advocate for being each other worst enemy with no family members around and no friends in sight.",
            "and they know how to line dance to Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton’s “Islands in the Stream”!",
            "Well, she did try to insinuate an affair with Nacho (2/2 jam?). It costed her being Delfina’s +1 on Gwyneth Paltrow’s luncheon 😂",
            "I think Amal was just being a famewhore and decided to accept the wedding invitation even though she didn't know Harry and Meghan. I doubt Clooney gave a fuck about going, he just made his wife happy.\nAmal was truly thirsty for attention at some point.",
            "He said he didn’t know them in the dry way he says things. But like, he was being serious LOL.\n\nExcept he did some to her defense a couple times of I can remember. I’m sure that was to make himself look good at the time as well.",
            "I had the impression that they both came from the same “unicorn bride” PR company, the way they both smile for the camera and posing for the paps, like Amal famous lawyer who never lead a case ( but knew where to be and when and George needed a rebranding) and this South Park character allegedly actress ( to her defense i recognized her in shows twice so far , girl on a plane in Psych and two days ago she had few minutes in one episode of Fringe), but\nAmal has ( or has learned or had bought) more class, definitely better educated, better work done, in one word smarter than this user and abuser",

Who acts like this? She's had 8 years of bad behavior that people have spoken up about starting from the Reitmann's photoshoot up to the recent Hollywood Reporter article.

They flew all that way! \n\nApparently the PR at the time was that the evening reception was for their new and future friends. Just tactless and off. A double insult.",

            "*And now the end is near, and so I face the final curtain*\n\n🎤😏",
            "Not defending Harry at all because he's a jerk who deserves Meghan Markle, but imagine how exhausting it is for him to be married to a woman like that.  In Meghan's eyes, nothing is ever right or good enough or just enough in general. That's why he always looks mad and despondent whenever he's around her but is jovial when she's not around.  Personally, I don't feel any sympathy for him because he's a mf'ing prince, so he's not trapped in that marriage.  There will always be a way out for him.  He's got family who would still help him and plus, he's a prince so other high profile people would help him.  ",

            "And they worked for decades at it. They have been famous since they were young, but they really worked at making it in the US. They clearly take advice, work very hard, show up and are professional. Demanding but fair. David Beckham is an elite athlete. He has been trained to take direction, listen, and then lead.\n\nHe would have been a great mentor to the Sussexes.",
            "\"She likely thought the Beckhams were below her, and would always be looking to use her and her new connections.\"\n\nThis is what I believe too; she believed she was THE HOTTEST SHIT in the lead up to the wedding.",

            "\"For all of Meghan’s thinking that she belongs with the big players, this behaviour shows she is not.\"\n\nThis was clear the moment she decided to sit with Oprah and air dirty laundry about other famous rich people- in that case, it was her in-laws, but all it communicates to everyone else is that she can't keep a confidence and has no discretion.",

Not one of them ever lost faith in the other. Such a strong family unit. When our Queen passed away, David queued all night to pay his respects. It's things like this that makes them popular. Those carparkles behave as tho they are the Messiah, so pious & spend their days forcing themselves to be winners of another award. It's pathetic. They collect money, put it in archewell, then use it for 'expenses'. Just pathetic",

            "David Beckham, whose net worth exceeds a staggering £250 million, continues to augment his fortune through his ambassadorial role for the Qatari government. While he is legendary, his current business activities raise serious ethical concerns. Beckham played a key role in promoting Qatar's World Cup hosting, and now he's advocating for their acquisition of Manchester United, a club he once served with distinction.\n\nThe implications of such a takeover are far-reaching and demand scrutiny. Qatar's government has been linked to extremist groups, including providing safe harbor to leaders of Hamas. This isn't just a business deal; it's a political maneuver with considerable geopolitical implications. The prospect of a club as iconic as Manchester United being acquired by a government with such a problematic record should give pause to anyone concerned with ethical governance.\n\nMoreover, it's essential to note that any Western individual who accepts payment from Qatar or Saudi Arabia for their so-called \"sportswashing\" projects is complicit in funding terror. Such involvement essentially means having blood on one's hands, given the regimes' ties to extremist groups.",

It's the equivalent of buying a mint.\n\nI think COVID is what fucked up the delicate balance between revenue and debt. They've been towing that fine line of spending just enough on transfers, paying off some debt and then paying themselves dividends for too long until the pie shrunk and is unable to cover all three areas suitably.",

            ">Emilia Clarke has been made an MBE alongside her mother Jenny for their work establishing a brain injury charity. Emily and her mother co-founded SameYou, a brain injury recovery charity they established after the actress survived two brain hemorrhages.\n\n>Emilia first had a bleed on her brain in 2011, just after the first season of Game Of Thrones had finished filming, and she lost her ability to speak as she almost slipped into a coma. Her second bleed in 2013 needed surgery after scans showed it had doubled in size, and Emilia has previously told how she was in the 'really small minority' of people who have survived and been left with 'no repercussions'.\n\n>The experience prompted Emilia and her mother Jennifer to set up charity SameYou to raise funds and help increase neuro-rehabilitation access after brain injury and stroke.",

            "I was recovering from a stroke when she launched this charity. I had heard about her health issues, but didn’t know a lot about it. I looked into it and found The New Yorker article she wrote about her ordeal, and it helped me so much with the post-stroke anxiety that doctors never warned me about. After reading this entry, the panic attacks still sucked, but I somehow was able to manage them slightly better every time. It’s been over 3 years, and while I still suffer from minor anxiety attacks, I can’t remember the last time I had a true panic, especially from a headache. \n\n“A few weeks after that second surgery, I went with a few other cast members to Comic-Con, in San Diego. The fans at Comic-Con are hardcore; you don’t want to disappoint them. There were several thousand people in the audience, and, right before we went on to answer questions, I was hit by a horrific headache. Back came that sickeningly familiar sense of fear. I thought, This is it. My time is up; I’ve cheated death twice and now he’s coming to claim me. As I stepped offstage, my publicist looked at me and asked what was wrong. I told her, but she said that a reporter from MTV was waiting for an interview. I figured, if I’m going to go, it might as well be on live television. But I survived. I survived MTV and so much more. In the years since my second surgery I have healed beyond my most unreasonable hopes. I am now at a hundred per cent.”",

Good short and long passing, good reading of the game, great engine, tenacious, enjoyed a tackle.\n\nNot sure he had the pace to be a top class wing back.

            "Calling him more intelligent than Trent is frankly bizarre.  Trent is one of the most intelligent players around.\n\nWe know exactly what sort of player Beckham was because we can watch his whole career.  He had a lot of stamina and would be good in a press, but a lot of his running was fairly aimless ball chasing.  \n\nHe was not great in open play during the 99 final.  Did you forget that United were toothless and losing until those set pieces in the very final seconds?\n\nBeckham was a good player with a great passing range but the revisionism around him is incredible.  Nobody at the time would have said Beckham was a better or more important player for United than Scholes, Keane or Giggs.\n\nHe played in central midfield for England against Northern Ireland in 2005.  England lost.",
            "Plenty worse players than Beckham play a Pirlo type role.",
            "He did it all the time? Remember that season Van Nistlerooy scored about 45 goals? Half of those were Beckham dropping the ball at his feet from crosses.",

            "How is that a straw man? You said he had poor ability - based on your (shit) opinion. I have demonstrated 4 excellent clubs with world class managers all consistently picked him over a 19 year career. Directly contradicting your statement that he was a limited player",
            "> Calling him more intelligent than Trent is frankly bizarre. Trent is one of the most intelligent players around.\n\nHe really isn't, and that's coming from a Liverpool fan. He has exceptional long passing technique (for me he's the best in the world by a good way) but his positional intelligence in the middle of the park is, right now, extremely subpar.",
            "Yes I agree. I also don’t think Beckham was particularly good at it either. Good on the right though. There is a stack of revisionist takes on Beckham. He was never a playmaker or someone controlled a game.",
            "No, it was RVNs ability to get on the end of anything that was speculatively knocked into the box.\n\nWhy the fuck every side in the premiership thought that leaving Beckham the time and space to stop the ball have a think and a wee run up is the real question here.\n\nGenuinely wonder how Ferguson managed that.",
            "Absolutely not. Decent player with a world class dead ball",
            "Beckham had the technique of KDB but no where near the vision so no he wasn't every bit as good as KDB at that role. \n\nBeyond hitting it accurately which Beckham was great at it's also the vision to see the pass. Becks had ok vision but that wasn't his speciality.",

It used to be so quiet on my road,” Wahlberg told [Daily Mail](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/moslive/article-1238052/Mark-Wahlberg-I-left-mean-streets-Hollywood.html#ixzz0b6IkBfOr) in **2009**. “Then David moves in with his family. Suddenly we’ve got paparazzi hanging out day and night. Now they’ll follow any car that drives down the road. I take strong exception to that kind of thing. When I take my kids to the park I don’t want strangers sticking their lenses into our faces.”\n\nHe added: “I’m not telling Beckham to take his family home. I’m just not sure why he came to America in the first place. Man, we don’t want your soccer. There’s no way Americans are going to buy the idea of 90 minutes of running around without much happening. Thanks for trying guys, but we’ll stick to baseball and basketball.”\n\nDespite his inflammatory comments, Wahlberg wanted to ensure there was no animosity between the pair and declared Beckham seemed like ‘a nice guy’. Their relationship positively developed, as Beckham agreed to serve as the global ambassador for F45 Training, a company partially owned by Wahlberg in August 2021.\"",

It got fairly repetitive so he dropped it after a few episodes, but we found our \"Retirement Job Goal\" on that show. There was a couple in their own barge that simply puttered up and down a particular stretch selling tea and pre-packaged baked goods to other boaters.  Sounded awesome to us!\n\nAlso, I am still dreaming of this cream tea I had in Exeter five years later. We Americans really don't understood how good real Devon Clotted Cream can be.  Though I did just find a WI recipe online to make my own clotted cream on the stovetop, which is so much easier than baking it!  I make it with cream from a local dairy that does low-temp pasteurization so it's a bit more amenable to the clotting process - the more industrial high-speed variety doesn't always clot well.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7wmh4zuor64d1.png?width=1386&format=png&auto=webp&s=d00b1758db45028d134de58452c2d22ffd0d2bdd",

            "Ha!  The nice owner of the restaurant we had that tea at said it just comes down to scone temperature and preserving the texture of the clotted cream, which made sense to me.\n\n* So with a warm scone (Cornish), you put the jam down first as an insulator to keep the clotted cream from getting too melted.\n* With a cold scone (Devon), you put the cream down first since it won't melt the cream and it is basically easier to spread cold jam on top of the cold clotted cream.\n\nThough as it turns out, I did it wrong - they were warm scones since they baked them in their own kitchen, so I should have put the jam down first.  But he assured me that at the end of the day, it's all tasty so he was actually pretty agnostic about it.  (I figured as long as he was selling scones, he wasn't going to argue with how people ate them!)\n\nI loved when the Google Doodle about this had one of each type, and each scone was side-eyeing the other...🤣\n\n[https://doodles.google/doodle/celebrating-scones/](https://doodles.google/doodle/celebrating-scones/)",

And he was a bit of a jerk because this was an after-party where all the workers for Metallica were invited (roadie's, technicians, everyone) there was a vip person for the band but they all came out to take photos and be cool, especially Robert Trujillo and James. Anyhow, this guy was like \"stay the fuck away from me\" and it was hilarious since in the world of rock he's a nobody.",
            "I gotta say that the clotted cream we had in Devon from a local producer was miles better than the clotted cream we got at other teas.

He wasn't good because he was able to do it, he was good because no one could stop him from doing it. IF anyone here follows nhl Ovechkin isn't good cause he scores goals on the powerplay, hes good because everyone knows where he is going to shoot from and yet no body can stop him.",

Ginola was exciting to watch but Beckham stood out in an outstanding team that won a treble. \n\nNot to mention the mental fortitude he displayed. It gets brushed under the carpet but he was public enemy number 1 after the sending off against Argentina. He got abuse everywhere, which the press encouraged. He’s a national darling now, partly to gloss over how vile people were to him.\n\nI also miss getting excited at every corner or free kick. He always made something happen.",

Kanchelskis took a while to lock down the right after Giggs kept Sharpe’s position on the left. Giggs and Kanchelskis would switch sides too but you had this symmetry of fast wingers whatever side they took.\n\nKanchelskis is replaced by Beckham and there was a real asymmetry that worked out.

UEFA and Barcelona are both corrupt. He was robbed of Ballon Dor in 99. He literally scored against Barcelona himself in the UCL group stage to equalize for United and won the treble only for the corrupt org and club to give the award to Rivaldo. clownshow.\n\nMy favourite player of all time. Dont take any of this from me, take it from his teammates like Cantona, Keane, Zidane, R. Carlos, Ronaldo Nazario, Figo, Rio, his England teammates whom he carried in every qualifier and tournament who let him down.\n\nGo ask Cole, RVN, Ronaldo Nazario, Zidane or anyone who played with him or even against him who d they want on their imaginary world XI and he s on all of them, first name on the sheet for the strikers, no doubt in my mind.\n\nWe will never see anything like him ever again.\n\nGentleman, Icon, Genius, Leader, Team player.",

IMO only Figo has been a better right sided midfielder.",

            ">>Beckham average distance covered in a premier league game was 14.1km\n\nI know we’d want players who run more just like the old days. But as what the studies he mentioned, the intensity of premier league has increased a lot over the years.\n\nOf course the player’s athleticism improved but i dont think it ever caught up to the intensity of the game. And that doesnt even cover how much the volume of games have increased since then.\n\nThe combination of game volume + distance covered + intensity would just resulted in a possibility of career ending injury. So the players now ran lesser distance to avoid risks of injury which i honestly believe was also instructed by the coach/medical team as well.\n\nI dont believe in this modern game that beckham would run that much. But i’d love to see some of his brilliant passes and crosses in this modern era and see how our strikers would handle it.",

            "Best actual winger I’ve ever seen. Then when he transitioned to midfield he was incredible. The way he played under Fergie was more of a right-sided central midfielder and there are people who compare him with the current game’s right-wingers, which is an unfair comparison.",
            "Until 2001 Becks was one of the very best midfielders in the world. After 2001 he was still top tier, but arguably not quite world class anymore. But he was top tier for another 8-9 years after his very best spell, so hard to criticise him overly. He didn't fall off to the same degree as someone like Owen did.",
            "Yes, he gets thrown Into the “deadball specialist” pile, but he was so much more than that. Massive stamina and work rate great, team player excellent passing ability and great on field vision, and obviously an amazing crosser. Lacked that extra yard of pace but that wasn’t his game anyway.",

            "Beck’s isn’t a national treasure….he’s a worlds treasure",
            "Is that even a question! David Beckham was absolutely awesome! One of the greatest players of all time.  And ostracised by that Italian tit that unfortunately managed England.",
            "I used to think he was too slow and slowed the game down with his long cross field passes. It’s only when he left I realised how much we missed that ability / vision to switch the play and stretch opponents. It’s worth more than pace.",
            "Beckham today would be a cheat code for many teams. His pin-point crossing is totally out of this world and would give strikers many free goals for his team. He also has world class freekicks, setpieces, work rate and most accurate long pass on the pitch.\n\nI think De Bruyne is one player who would be playing most similar to Beckham in current era.",

            "Somehow underrated because of his fame people underestimated him.",
            "His crosses to RVN were a thing of beauty. Pin point accuracy most of the time, and you always had this feeling Ruud was going to slot them away.",

            "Fact",
            "Agreed",
            "Robben is another prime example of exactly this phenomenon",
            "I think the video does a great job of highlighting exactly why he wasn't a one-trick pony \nE.g. his workrate was quite literally being off the charts. His ability to excel in a more central position later in his career, to the point whereby he may arguably have been better suited all along.",
            "It’s like saying Haaland is a one trick pony because he only scores inside the 6 yard box with mostly his left foot",
            "He wasn’t even a one trick pony. Beckham was one of the most unique player ever because of his kicking ability.",
            "At least he was a one trick pony who did that trick exceptionally well. Hard to think of someone else, there are but not a lot, who can curl a cross in from deep as well as Becks. Not to mention he was great at freekicks too. During an era where wingers commonly play deeper than this era, he most certainly was top class at what he does.",
            "Yah, like Wayne Gretzky was the best, but people also loved that he was surprising and did sorta untraditional things. Like he could weave a pass or get an assist from the most unlikely plays. It was exciting. The only thing surprising about Ovechkin is that he can remain such a powerhouse at his age. He is just good at hockey, big, strong, and plays straightforward attacking forward hockey better than probably anyone. Like you said, everyone knows what he is trying, but he can still make it happen despite that.",
            "Haaland last year…..",
            "He had an amazing ability to pass the ball with amazing accuracy. In football. If that's a one trick pony, so is anyone who can run fast or shoot the ball well. He's great because of the chances he was able to create. When you can consistently put the ball in dangerous places, isn't that pretty damn good? Even better when when you can do it from a distance? Now add some crazy spin with the same precision. Pretty fucking amazing if you ask me. He's so underrated because people expected him to score goals which wasn't the priority of the position he played. This same reason why defenders won't win the Ballon D'or, it's not flashy enough for the mouth breathing masses.",

The brand will look like a single misshapen lump, because the area will be burned to full-thickness and lack any kind of definition. \n\nIf you're branding through hair and thick hide it makes sense, but even then contact isn't held very long. \n\nIn a nutshell, if you want to \"brand\" yourself without just ending up with a big blob of a scar, the metal only needs to be around cookie-cutter thickness if heated to cherry-red as steel (Still around 1200-1400 degrees) and only held for 1-2 seconds of firm contact.

Build a model of an undersea thermal vent, with all its creatures, for a new marine education centre; paint a foam copy of this shillelagh to look exactly like the real one for a movie; make a toy derringer look like a real one for a TV show; make the knots in this real totem pole look like regular wood; fab a giant sandwich for an airport eatery... big jobs, little jobs, you never knew who or what was coming in the door.  \nAlas, it all fell apart when a silent partner started throwing their unhinged weight around and we split from the prop business. We still did some, but the magic of our co-op effort was gone. I retired at the end of '22, so now just work on personal hobby projects!",

(admittedly i wrote per gram, but i guess this is my redaction after the peer review :) ). among solid materials though they do have great volumetric thermal capacity. In general, liquids and gasses have much higher thermal capacity per mass unit than solids. hydrogen gas for example has a truly exceptional heat capacity per mass (much greater than water), however it is impractical for ***most*** common heat transfer and storage applications.\n\nso i guess my thought process when i wrote it was that for solid materials, metals can in general be considered to have pretty high volumetric thermal capacity, especially when compared to a super lightweight insulator material [like the one used in the space shuttles thermal tiles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp9Yax8UNoM) :)",

            "I haven't seen any, to be honest, although that's not say they don't exist. One is often flying by the proverbial seat of your pants when figuring out how to make some pieces, but some of the most important skills would be:  \n-Wood and plastic working with table saw, drill, milling machine, lathe, etc.  \n-Painting using airbrush (including big spray guns) and detailing with brushes and enamels, latex, or even craft paints. Faux finishes like weathering, metal, rust, and burnt wood are commonly needed.  \n-Casting and mold-making for resin or expanding soft foam items (made lots of those!)!  \n-Foam carving with rigid foam using hot wire cutter, saws, etc.  \n-Design software use, for laser cutting and 3D printing. This was something I didn't have available in earlier years, but it makes complex pieces so much easier and faster that it is a basic requirement for anyone going into models and/or props today.  \n-Basic electronics knowledge is an asset (thinking of the branding iron!).  \n  \nMostly, you have to think on your feet for best (and often fastest) way to do something. I recall the guys making an electric chainsaw look gas-powered and rigging it with a rubber \"chain,\" and a crossbow with stretchable cord to gently loft foam-tipped bolts, both directed at zombies. Lots of weapons made of wood, bamboo, foam (including pool noodles and backer rod), barbed wire made of soft electrical wire and bits of leather - anything you could safely bonk a costumed stuntman/woman with!",

He desperately wants that K and he's arguably done far more for the country than many many others who have one so if he gets one fair enough. He does do a lot to raise the UK profile he's got global name recognition and he'll do a good job. \nThe queuing to pay respects to HMTLQ I'm not going to give him any more credit for than anyone else that queued. I don't believe he was offered an opportunity to skip the queue I think that was PR but I do think he did genuinely want to pay his respects like thousands of others. He's a young fit man who doesn't have a boss to answer to. There were many who had to take a day's holiday or unpaid leave to do it and a lot of them were much older than him. He us smart enough to know that if he had been offered the chance to queue jump and take it he would have been slaughtered in the media. \nDavid has got where he has got to by having talent being handsome working hard and most importantly by listening to very good PR and business advice.  These are all qualities Harry lacks. They should have studied the Beckhams very closely. They are expert players of the game. It's no accident that VB is the most successful of the ex spice girls.

Idk if there was a dress code but Sonam, Anand, Rhea, Mallika and Karishma are dressed very much in tune with the setting of the party. Even Shanaya somehow comes close but the whole panty-sheer dress is overkill. Mira and Shahid look nice but seem mismatched with the overall vibe of the party. I love Rhea and Sonam's looks.",
