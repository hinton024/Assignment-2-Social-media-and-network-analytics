1,Thanks for sharing ☺️
1,"Fordi det gjennomsnittlige menneske er ganske dumt, og bryr seg altså om hva ""kjendiser"" bruker."
1,"Det handler ikke om at Beckham kan noe som helst om lyd, det handler om at folk ser at en kjent person bruker et produkt, og så føler en form for ""nærhet"" med den gitte personen. Alternativt er det også så simpelt som at det kan assosieres med kvalitet, ikke fordi personen kan noe som helst om produktet, men fordi forbrukere går ut ifra at en såpass kjent person med såpass mye penger naturligvis bruker ""bra produkter"". 

Ganske rart å tenke sånn mtp at de får betalt for å bruke produktet, men det er altså en tankegang som eksisterer

Om jeg ikke husker helt feil så var det Rolex som startet hele trenden med ""ambassadører"". I deres tilfelle brukte de ""Mercedes Gleitze"" som hadde på seg en av deres da nye Oyster modeller (vanntett klokke) mens hun svømte over den engelske kanalen."
1,Takk for at du setter ord på det!
1,Trodde det bare var jeg som fikk annonsen siden jeg så en dokumentar om vedkommende på Netflix ?
1,"Har heller aldri skjønt denne kjendistilbedelsen. Men jeg har skjønt at den gemene hop faller for dette. Den samme gjengen som stemmer på politiker X fordi ""han er jo så kjekk"" eller ""har karisma""."
1,Ironisk nok fikk jeg nettopp opp den reklamen rett under denne posten.
1,Helt enig. Helt enig. Helt enig. Det er en av de verste jeg har sett. Skjønner ikke hvem som biter på den. Hva er målgruppa her?
1,"Jeg kan lite om lyd, men mer om foto, og Beckham brukte et Hasselblad kamera som er et rebranded Sony-kamera til en mye høyere pris. Beckham fikk sikkert betalt for å bruke det, men ikke f\*\*\* om jeg skal betale ekstra for å bytte merke som står forann på kamera når det ellers er identisk. Regner med at dette er noe tilsvarende."
1,"De fleste som jobber med reklame tenker ikke nødvendigvis at folk vil kjøpe de for å være som Beckham, men du kjenner igjen trynet til fyren og det blir et blikkfang til reklamen. 

Husk også at ikke alle reklamer har som mål å selge deg noe med en gang. Jeg ser den reklamen hver gang jeg bæsjer for da bruker jeg mobilappen til reddit. Og hver gang legger jeg merke til trynet til Beckham som gjør at jeg får med meg reklamen, som igjen kan føre til at B&W havner ""top of mind"" når jeg skal tenkte på hodetelefoner. 

Jeg tror få folk kjøper et headset til kr+ på impuls. De fleste kjøper ikke heaset så veldig ofte heller. Så når jeg først skal handle et headset er det veldig fint for B&W at det er en merkevare jeg har blitt utsatt for daglig de siste månedene."

1,Eg fjerna appen etter at eg bladde gjennom eit kommentarfelt og midt inni der kom det ei annonsa i formen av ein kommentar. Takk og farvell!
1,">Jeg er temmelig sikker på at tekstforfatteren for denne hater jobben og sjefen sin.

Trur ikkje AI har lært desse følelsene enda, men den dagen den gjer det så starter Skynet sin atomkrig."
1,"Same! Når de både bruker AI og Beckham i annonsene sine så bommer de ganske grovt og de skjønner ikke helt hvem demografien deres er.

Det er vel desverre et forsøk på å tiltrekke seg nye kunder som ligger utenfor demografien (vekst, vekst, vekst!), og det går ofte på bekostning av hva som gjorde merkevaren spesiell i utgangspunktet."
1,Jeg forsto den referansen
1,"Creative Director er sjefen for markedsføringsavdelingen.

Det er vel få som er bedre på markedsføring enn nettopp Lady Gaga.

Det er jo ikke som om markedsføringsfolka i Stabburet er dyktige på å lage frossen mat."
1,Det er faktisk akkurat det her
1,"Jeg var innom for en del år siden og spurte etter et merke de ikke hadde (sikkert fordi det var for billig). Var på utkikk etter en stereo til -k. Selgeren tok meg da direkte med på bakrommet der de hadde en demo av noe sinnsyke greier. Forsterkeren var i glass og kostet k. Høytaler kabler til k meteren og helt på bærtur hele opplegget (jeg har utdanning innen elektronikk). Så jeg bare nikket og sa noe sånn som at jaja, det er sikkert fint, og så forlot jeg den butikken for siste gang. Når de prøver å selge meg optiske kabler med gull-kontakter da forlater jeg samtalen ..."
1,"I beats sitt tilfelle så har lyden vært ræva uansett hvilket navn som kommer etter ""by"" "
1,">et selskap som jeg ikke tar alt for seriøst når de selger svindyre signalkabler.

Det gjør strengt tatt alle(spesialiserte) A/V-sjapper eg kjenner til. Men ja, er mykje snake oil og placebo ute og går innan high-end sjiktet, spesielt ang. kablar."
1,"Tror også man bør huske på at man ofte betaler mye for design og merkenavn. Mange ønsker noe fint å se på og vise frem i stua når de kjøper høyttalere. Om man kun er interessert i lyd og blåser i hvordan det ser ut kan man få høyttalere til rimeligere pris. Man kan også få høyttalere med lengre holdbarhet om man ikke er opptatt av design.  

Annet tips er å huske på at rommet påvirker lyden enormt. Så hvordan høyttalerne høres i butikken og hvordan de høres ut hjemme kan være veldig forskjellig. Butikken har selvsagt prøvd å optimalisere hvor bra høyttalerne høres ut ved å plassere dem i rom og i avstander som gir best mulig lytteopplevelse.

Så kjøper man høyttaler bør man teste dem ut hjemme og ikke i butikken. I tillegg ville jeg sjekket på nettforumer og lignende om holdbarheten på det man kjøper. Det gjelder både det elektroniske om det holder, men også om man kan forvente at relevante apper og slikt får oppdateringer og om høyttalerne kan brukes om appene slutter å fungere. 

Dette svaret var egentlig ikke ment direkte til deg. Det var mer som tilleggsopplysninger til de som vurderer å kjøpe dyre høyttalere."
1,"Jeg skulle kjøpe meg høyttaler forleden - et tema jeg kan absolutt null om - hva gjorde jeg? Googlet meg frem til ca åtte ulike best i test - artikler, fant prisklassen min og kjøpte den høyttaleren alle de åtte testene anbefalte til mitt bruk. 

Kjøpte selvfølgelig på nett etter å ha sjekket alle nettbutikkene. Folk på besøk lurer stadig på hvilken butikk jeg gikk til for å finne den og jeg rister på hodet hver gang over at de tror jeg gikk til en butikk som bare ville forsøkt å lure meg."
1,"Ja, det og."
1,"Ja, det velger å signalisere at de ikke kan noe om faget, eller villig lurer folk for å tjene noen kjappe gryn, det er greit nok det, men det gjør noe med hvor seriøst jeg tar rådene fra de."
1,"HFK er ikke solgt, samme eiere som alltid. Peter Lyngdorf"
1,"Ikke bare er den digital, men protokollet har såklart mekanismer for å integritets-sjekke datapakker (CRC) og be om nye hvis det er feil på dem"
1,"For meg som ikke er ekspert på usb-kabler: hvordan har det seg sånn at en kabel som er to meter lenger (m vs m) koster nesten K mindre enn den kortere? Jeg ville jo nesten gjettet det motsatte, mtp materialer og signal/overføringslengde. 

Nei, her er det nok svindel på gang"
1,"Jepp. Så det er \*flere\* grunner til at en kabel med spesifikasjoner mye bedre enn det som kreves av standarden gjør NULL forskjell. 

Lyd er jo dessuten trivielle datamengder, så høy kapasitet kreves heller ikke. Selv om du gjør noe tullete som  bits sampling med Khz og sender dataene ukomprimert, så blir det likevel bare .Mbps per kanal. 

hifi-duster tror likevel at det er ENORME krav til overføringen og det koster TUSENVIS om ikke TITUSENVIS av kroner pr. meter å lage en kabel som kan dytte denne trivielle datamengden fra punkt A til punkt B uten tap."
1,"Dr Dre klarte jo faktisk å lage et helt søppel produkt og markedsføre det så bra at haugevis av folk som ikke vet hva som er god og dårlig lyd kjøpte de.

Om du tror kvaliteten på merkevaren har noe som helst å si for oppkjøpet så er du nok på villspor. Det er jo helt absurd høy merkevaregjenkjenning på Beats blant folk, noe billig dritt til dyr pris blir det nok videre også."
1,Det er det samme med alle hobbyer.  Du ser godt korpulente menn på sykler til uante summer som betaler flere tusen for karbonflaskeholdere som sparer gram på vekta. De kunne droppet EN forbanna lunch og oppnådd det samme.  Folk må få bruke penger på det de vil :)
1,"På jobb hadde vi en rigg som lastet opp firmware til ca.  kretskort på en gang, hvor det som ble sendt inn var én overføring på  KB, lastet opp med en hastighet langt under Mbps. Vi ønsket så korte kabler som mulig for å unngå kveiler med kabler som lå overalt, siden kretskortene bare var ca.  cm fra hverandre og klistret fast på en USB hub.

Med billigste typer kabler vi fant, så fikk vi feil etter feil når vi forsøkte å bare spørre kortene om en ID. Dette var en forespørsel på bare et par bytes. Forskjellen der er at USB-kontrolleren på kretskortene ikke takler USB som går alt for langt unna spec, og kablene var rett og slett så dårlige at data ikke alltid kom fram, og støy smittet mellom de pga. nærhet og dårlig terminering. Vi også trodde at det ikke var nødvendig med særlig gode kabler, siden det var lav båndbredde og lenge mellom hver overføring. Men der tok vi smertelig feil.

Vi skulle kjøpe ca.  stk. så vi testet dyrere og dyrere kabler til vi fant noe som endelig virket, og så kjøpte vi  av de. For kabler på ca.  cm måtte vi ut med kr per stk. for noe som faktisk fungerte."

2,"Why so rich people have this impulse to show they come from humble beginnings or that they worked hard to make their way to the top…  if you were born rich, so what?"
2,He's not letting her get away with that shit 😆
2,He’s dealt with her shit a million times before
2,"And this dear people is why I cancelled my Netflix subscription of this is the kind of embellished scripted nonsense they’re going to make, just like the Harry and Meghan documentary. I ain’t paying good hard earned money so they can release shit. Props to Becks for stepping in though"
2,Netflix is a pile of shit
2,"I had a friend like this. I remember she complained once saying ""everyone thinks my dad is rich just because he picks me up in a BMW with our name on the plates."". 

She bragged about saving up her hard earned money to buy her dog herself. Her dad paid her £ a day to sit at the front desk of one of his less busy shops for  hours. She made £ per hour... 

Biggest stand out is when I was down and she asked me what was wrong. I explained that my grandmother who raised me had passed, my dad was in jail, and I was going to be separated from my half sister so I was depressed. She said ""I get it. I had an iPhone and wanted a blackberry and my dad said no, but then I got him to get me one anyway. Then I didn't like the blackberry so I asked him for an iPhone *and he said no!* I think I'm going to run away."""
2,"I've grown up quite poor and have been poor to the point of homelessness as an adult, and these types seem like extreme ingrates to me. I would rather they cherish how easy they have had it financially and materially in a fairly humble way."
2,"Yeah a rich person willing to pretend like this what we are seeing is the tip of the iceberg. Narcissists gonna make the world worship them or burn down. 

Beckhams reacted to it with gas, good lad."
2,That is a side effect from botox
2,"> Personally, I think that rich people hate is kind of sad because it comes from jealousy and the sense that all rich people somehow got that money in an unfair way.

it's nigh on impossible to amass s of millions, let alone billions of dollars without taking obscene advantage of people.

and sure being born super rich is not shameful, maintaining the systems that got your family there is"
2,"Sports is one of the few places where talent can get you to top, and to stay at top you need to be good, no wonder people with hard work are more compared to ones with just connections and money"

2,"So, raping people and avoiding taxes is not taking advantage?"

2,As he should. I can’t stand when rich people try to downplay the wealth they grew up with. When he said what car did you take to school and she said ‘it depends’ like girl??
2,Money can't buy good spelling.

2,"When you're that rich and beatiful for some reason I always suspect they have some type of ""arrangement"" It would be odd for them to talk about it because, ya know, it's none of anyones business."
2,those are the heartless ones perhaps..
2,They forgotten the millions of money he has
2,Without money vs with money

2,David is me when rich people try to put themselves in my shoes.
2,Netflix
2,"She said it depends because it was going to be a Rolls or a Bentley, depending on which day it was."
2,"Honestly I feel like I'm getting there already. All this cross branding to make more money pisses me off. If you already have millions of dollars, you're fine. Let an entrepreneur get in on the pie!"
2,They've both done incredibly well from their relationship. It cemented both of them as global icons. It's hard to say that either of them would have had the same level of continued success in other fields that they have had without it.
2,Yeah he just happened one day to work so hard at his job they gave him a Rolls and said “your kid should be driven to school in this!”
2,With genes like that I'm pretty sure his parents worked very hard.
2,I bet £ this Redditor has depression.
2,You can just stop replying at any time you numpty
2,Wahlberg also has a history of racism and beat the shit out of an Asian man.
2,"He's been in some good ones, but his role in The Departed is that one for me."
2,They print money in Toronto and Vancouver.
2,This is hysterical. He was not going to back down 🤣
2,I used to wonder how their personalities meshed and this gave me *everything* I needed to know.
2,She needed to be humbled
2,Because they want others to believe they worked hard and earned it when most rich people had it handed to them.

10,"Yeah, I swear some middle class people seem to think ""well my dad had a job, so that must have made us working class right?""  


edit: Feel like middle class was a wider spread in the 's, and also, if I'm saying the middle class have this outlook, then it would make sense people more well off might also have the same logic. That's the way I was thinking about it anyway. Sorry for the confusion!  


edit: UK references to class are different from other countries and marxism. I am from the UK, she is from the UK. If you are from a different country, your definition and outlook on the terms isn't the same, please be aware of that before your condescending or snarky comments, they're boring and have been made way too many times now, like please.

10,"On another thread someone was arguing a tech worker making k a year was working class because they're a ""tech WORKER"" therefore working class..."
10,Well.   Working class is a stupid politically correct euphemism from a very classist country...
10,In the UK middle class means rich but not an aristocrat
10,The middle class are professional workers.
10,In the UK class isn't necessarily wealth based.
10,"In the US maybe that's the definition, but not in the UK. There's a big class divide in the UK that is of similar cultural impact as the racial divide in the US.

It would be hard to sum it all up, but it's something our country hasn't been able to shake. I'm from a working class background and it makes me feel very out of place to visit a middle class area."
10,"Can’t comment on electricians in the UK but electricians in the US make decent money and would be likely described as middle class. Definitely possible it’d be “lower middle class” depending on a bunch of factors, which would be struggling, at least in todays age."

10,"Yeah, only hoi polloi would use such a barbaric language."
10,"Just to confirm, in the UK there's no such thing as an ""upper class salary"". Being upper class is something you inherit, and there are as many broke upper class people as rich ones.

Having a really well paid salary would probably be something the true upper class look down on, because it means you have a job. And that's not very upper class."
10,"People are conflating working class with the US ""middle class"" even though ""middle class"" means something different in the UK (where there is a historical basis for class structure) than it does in the US and it's not just an indicator of how much you make but what you do for a living.  Electricians are a prime example of ""traditional working class"" in the UK."
10,"“Working Class Spice.”

Isn’t that just salt?"
10,"If you were working class, you would NOT drive a roller under any situation. You would be perceived as trying to be above your station by all. Luxury cars by definition are not what working class people spend their money on when a banger would suffice."
10,"Yeah, in Afrikaans a W is pronounced as V as well"
10,"Oh gosh, that's why poor people are often so salty!"
10,"protip: this isn't the US, not everything is about the US."
10,To be fair in the UK the classes aren’t defined by your wealth like in the US. It’s more of your background and mindset. Someone absolutely can be working class and rich - Lord Alan Sugar is another example of a rich working class man.
10,"He father had money and was working class 
money doesn’t equal class"
10,That spelling is very working class.
10,Their….so working class 😂
10,"What she said was: ""We're very working, working class."" 

Not ""I actually didn't grow up posh"", or ""I didn't grow up upperclass"", not ""we had money, but lived in a working class culture"", not even ""we were lower middle class"" or ""we had good money, but I always felt more aligned with working class people"". 

Fact is, they were not working class. They were very, comfortably middle class (with the wealth of an upper middle class family). 

In the UK class is also a matter of culture, yes, but you simply don't grow up being driven in a Rolls Royce while feeling ""embarrassed"" about just how rich your family is and then turn around and call yourself ""very working, working class"" (present tense while have a collection of over  Birkin bags lmao)"
10,Wealthy working class lmfao. Get the fuck out of here
10,Class is wealth based when it comes to working and middle class.
10,"Nah, this isn’t true. I’m also from the UK and class is determined by whether you are born into wealth; doesn’t matter if it’s generational or new money. Victoria’s parents can legitimately say they come from a working class background because they were born and grew up working class, and became wealthy later in their adult lives through hard work, grit and luck. However even they are no longer working class. Their children cannot claim to be working class because they were born and raised in money. They do not have any of the experiences that working class people have and cannot be truly familiar with working class culture. Victoria is upper-middle class, at the very least."
10,"Depends on how you define working class. In the uk it’s based on occupation and while he may been rich he was still a plumber and wouldn’t be considered upper class just nouveau riche.

Unlike America wealth doesn’t really influence your class standing as much as occupation."
10,… this is so rude 😂 you can be working class and educated.
10,Very working class
10,Social class in The UK is all about your parents income.
10,"Speaking RP English is a core part of class identity for middle class and upper class Brits, though. “You sound so middle class” is something Brits say precisely BECAUSE the accent is a key signifier."
10,"Easiest way to know what class you are in the UK.

If you clean your own house, working class.

If you pay a cleaner then you’re middle class

If your butler hires a cleaner for you, upper class"
10,You can be rich from a working class background
10,Very working class
10,Feeling sorry for someone & having value in yourself is not about money for me. In fact it’s people who are famous & rich who I often feel sorry for the most.
10,"Yes they are petit-borgeousie. They are not firmly middle class and that have a wildly different culture and outlook as well as cultural signifiers (accent) than the traditional middle class. I am from the traditional middle class and sound and act like it, but grew up with no money. Class =/= how much money you have."
10,"Yea, you’re from a working class background, however that doesn’t mean you are still working class. If you have kids they will not be working class. They will be born into extreme wealth by the sounds of it, and enjoy all the benefits and connections that comes with. They will be amongst the wealthiest percentile in the country and will not have the working class struggles and experiences that you did. They will not grow up in or be familiar with the culture you grew up in. They will be middle class at best. 

In fact, realistically even you probably don’t have as much in common with your working class friends as they have with each other because the level of wealth you have alienates you from the struggles and experiences they still live. 

This is Victoria’s situation. Her parents are from a working class background, however they are not working class anymore. You can describe them as being from a working class background and self-made, but you cannot say they are working class, as their lifestyle will not be comparable to that of truly working class people. Victoria was born into and grew up in money, so she cannot claim to be working class at all, she can’t even claim to be from a working class background. The most she can say is her parents were from a working class background and self-made."
10,They are not upper middle class
10,"I’m not guna split hairs over it, I feel fine saying comfortably middle class. But not working class is the point"
10,"They are what the upper middle class side of my family would refer to as ""very vulgar"" 😂. I wouldn't stoop to such pettiness myself, but referring to oneself as ""posh"" does invite comments!"

In the US, we think of working class to mean lower or lower-middle class, poor essentially. While in the UK, ""working class"" means something more akin to ""not born into an old money dynasty family"" or ""not a part of an upper-class family.""

Victoria Beckham's father was quite rich during her childhood, but he was largely self-made and not a part of an old family dynasty, which would put him firmly in the latter definition of working class.

The definition is slowly changing in the UK as the US definition is slowly being adopted. David Beckham is just milking the viral moment for more publicity for his documentary."
10,these people are corny as fuck pretending they're workers and not aristocrats
10,"It is so disgusting that rich people constantly want to be approved as ""working class""."
10,They are working my nerves alright 😅
10,"i mean, the upper class is also A working class in some way"
10,For her working class Hermes Picnic!!
10,"She's from the UK and she knows what working class means. It's not ""my parents had to work"". Claiming to be working class while your dad had a rolls Royce is ludicrous.

Also, the Middleton's are middle class. You can have millions of quid and still be middle class. Upper class is not the same as wealthy.

It's enlightening seeing Americans completely misunderstand our class system."
10,Are the middletons not upper middle class?
10,"Yeah, the Brits are weird when it comes to class.  It's all about who your parents or grandparents were, otherwise you're a social climber.  You can have millions and they'll call you middle class.

Working class means they actually had to work and it wasn't a professional job (then they'd be middle class).  Upper class means that your family has gone to fancy boarding schools for generations."
10,"That still doesn't make them ""very working class"", it seems they were pretty comfortably middle class."
10,"but she was BSing lol she knows they werent working class. middle class, yes, but not working"
10,"Yep, class can only transfer through generations. No living person can become a class that they weren't born into. Only their children can

And the only people who can become upper class, are already there, as the old families of the original landed gentry. So, as a correction to your comment *upper-middle class*. As that's the highest anyone can get outside of those specific families"
10,"Sorry but class distinctions are very clear and someone who has earned their place and owns a rolls is firmly middle, most likely upper middle class. She claimed to be working class which was fundamentally untrue. 

No mention was made to being upper class by anyone."
10,"Sure, but neither of those puts them in the working class, they can be upper class without being aristocracy but they're still firmly in the upper class."
10,Isn't he dyslexic?
10,"Exactly.  ""Working class"" isn't the same as ""not accepted by the upper class""."
10,"... That's exactly what I said 😭

That upper class in the UK isn't determined about how much money you have..."
10,"There's various definitions and changing perceptions of the class deliniations but the traditional one is:


* working class people are generally poorer, rent rather than own homes, and less likely to be university educated

* middle class people will be university educated, own their own homes, and live much more comfortably. They're more likely to be professionals and managers. 


There's cultural aspects to class that have evolved due to these groups of people not socialising with each other historically, so some people might argue they're working class even though they own a million pound home."
10,Middle has money. Working does not.
10,"In the UK, sweetie. Again, we do not have titled nobility as a concept elsewhere in the English speaking world. 

We *absolutely* have upper class people in America/Canada/Australia/wherever but the criteria for it are different. No one would ever describe bill gates as middle class, regardless of his parents' background."
10,Doesn't matter what the dollar amount is. He's a working professional. He is middle class. He's not an aristocrat.
10,Being in the top % doesn't make you upper class. It's not about salary or wealth. It's about your family lineage and if you need to work or not. Your father works and is therefore working class.
10,"> feel free to do some research

I have. More than once. 

There is no agreed upon definition of class in America. Or the UK, for that matter. It's not like an Indian caste.

Everybody has different ideas of what class is, or should be.

Be that as it may, tying it exclusively to salary seem counter-productive to me. 

""I was middle class up to around , then COVID came and I was working class for a while, I'm currenly upper class, let's see how long it lasts...""

It's non-sensical."
10,Your definition is middle class is wild. Have a good one!
10,"His father working would make him either middle class or working class.

Roughly speaking:

Working class is if he worked in a factory or a mine or as a manual labourer or a bus driver or a builder or a variety of other things.

Middle class is if he sat in an office somewhere."
10,"Yup, that's literally not a thing in America. Working class is synonymous with ""poor"" for the most part, middle class is ""comfortable"", and upper class just means ""rich"" here.

It's very different from Britain where upper class is more ""aristocracy"" and you can be rich and still be middle class because upper is going by a metric that isn't even wholly economic, and where working class isn't the lowest rung."
10,Upper class is actual aristocrats though? You can have wealthy lower and middle class
10,How dare you give me material that I can choose to include or exclude depending on how I want to spin my ejaculatory worship of your family!?!
10,Tbf she did grow up working class but her dad did well. Class is about more than money in Britain.
10,based eggcorn peddler
10,Class isn’t a binary between working and upper in any country. She grew up (very) upper-middle class. Her dad owned his own business.
10,The people in the background not even watching
10,Next up...Mark Wahlberg doing comedy
10,She's rich enough not to have to clean her own clothes
10,Her dad drove her himself? How very working class
10,Middle class people have no clue what working class life is like.
10,My family moved from the UK to Australia when I was like  and I remember seeing how many people had pools in their back yards and thinking they were all SO Rich 🤣
10,I did wonder if she meant ‘culturally’ working class like she had money but her parents were from a working class background. In the uk I feel like we see class an identity as well as an indication of your finances
10,UK’s obsession with class has always been so weird to me.
10,Audi and Volkswagon are pretty much common working class cars in the UK.
10,Parents were both working class yeah
10,"In the uk, that would be considered working class."
10,"Definitely working class, it goes on the type of job. Builders and hairdressers are working class."
10,Trades = working class. Middle class would generally require a university education or at least white collar job.
10,"You can do that and be loaded. One o my local 'construction' chaps owns  houses and drives an audi tt to pick up his van. 

Class can be very different to wealth; you can be working class as fuck and rich and be upper class and broke."
10,"Middle class in the UK has a different connotation than in the US. It’s more like lower levels of the upper class in the US. Like %er but not .%er.

In the US we treat middle class as basically anyone who lives off of a full time job, whether they make $k or $k. The poor are those who work either significantly less or significantly more, and the rich are those who don’t need to work at all (but often do to accrue a larger hoard).

In the UK actually being proper upper class has as much to do with breeding as it does with wealth."
10,Isn’t the middle class the working class? Lol
10,"Without knowing their salaries, and without any additional insight this can easily be middle class. Having lived in the UK, I have always been under the impression middle class in the uk is different than a middle class in North America. I did some digging and nothing is suggesting otherwise. With those specific kind of jobs? I would be surprised if they weren’t middle class."
10,"So you're either poor or rich in UK? It's interesting how the perspective change from countries.

In Brazil we have something like: lower class (actual poor people) > low middle class > high middle class > high class > millionaires. Most people here are low class and low middle class. What determines the class someone is is the monthly income and not what you do for a living, our government does it. So acording to herr Victoria would be considered high middle class and David low middle class?"
10,"Yeah, that's not bullying."
10,"It's not really subjective for those professions. Both the trade itself *and* salary are considered working class. They are also sometimes looked down upon by white collar professionals.

Source: working class to my core, and saw the prejudice first hand from my rich ex gfs parents"
10,"That’s not how the class system works here. % is working class and would never be considered middle class. Class isn’t about salary here, either. Class is about your background, family, social, etc. A working class man can make a six figure salary and he’s still working class."
10,"Class in the UK isn't just about money. Hairdressing and trades work would be considered working class, whereas a teacher might earn less but be considered middle class. It's weird over here."
10,Honestly class in the UK is complicated but a lot of it is to do with ‘cultural capital’. Generally trade people/hairdressers would be considered working class.
10,k middle class...lmao
10,"What're you on about, those are two quintessentially working class jobs. Class has very little to do with salary."
10,"The Brits are ‘interpreting it in the British way’ because it’s a post about being working class in Britain. You were using the American definition of middle class (akin to middle income), applying it to the UK and then insisting that your interpretation is correct."
10,so are you not also a class traitor
10,"Those were her parents, the hairdresser and engineer"
10,How? I am working class and I support other working class people in my community.
10,"his dad was a kitchen fitter and his mum a hairdresser, so my point still stands and OP’s does not. those roles are not middle class."
10,"Because ""middle class"" is some bullshit made up by the wealthy to divide the working class on each other so we don't focus on the owner class."
10,Marky Mark is such a carny
10,Mark Wahlberg should have stopped /
10,marky mark is crook.. his movies are dog poop
10,TIL that Mark Wahlberg owns F🤯
10,I think Mark Whalber is conspiring with Mark Wahlberg on this one. Too close to be a coincidence…
10,Thus is what I was thinking
10,"You can be working class and have a Rolls Royce if you working class job is chauffeur.

Not saying that's the case here though."
10,Working class spice
10,It’s as if rich people’s definition of working class is “my dad had work therefore I’m working class”
10,Too much working class 😕
10,She thinks because her dad went to work every day and they weren’t as rich as she is now that she is part of the working class.  Or she mistook it for working + class.
10,Working class?! 😂😂☠️☠️☠️
10,Isn’t it funny how deep down most people are ashamed to be rich..
10,"They were very very working class. LMFAO. 

Working class people don’t have a RR in their  car garage."
10,Neither she nor her audience is interpreting “class” in terms of classic Marxist theory…
10,"Working class is a class of people, on a social hierarchy. It doesn’t mean rich people don’t work. Hence the ‘class’"
10,"Working middle class? That’s working class, ain’t no one being middle class on hairdressing and kitchen fitting"
10,"Yeah, if ONE of your cars costs more than most peoples houses, you may not want to play up the we were working class people card"
10,Correct. On “the verge of homeless” class
10,Where do you draw the line between middle and working class?
10,"Not in the UK, middle class is usually white collar - a plumber on £k is working class, a teacher on £k is middle class."
10,"Noo, they were working class through and through"
10,"There is a distinction in the UK though. They literally have a caste system. 

For example, working class is DB’s parents. Trades, not making a lot of money, etc. Middle class people can be very wealthy. Kate Middleton is middle class and her parents are millionaires and she went to the same high school as a literal prince, but she was still middle class. You can’t just jump to upper class in the UK by being rich, there’s a lot more than comes to it (by design)."
10,"It isn't strictly (or even mainly) economic in the UK, it is an identity"
10,">Wait, in the UK Middle Class is considered more wealthy than Working Class? 

>In the US, the two are generally reversed. Working class would be more in line with poverty, living paycheck to paycheck working laborious or service-industry jobs. Middle class is your average desk worker

I'm confused what you are asking?

You just asked if working class in the Uk earns less. Then you said it was the opposite in the US, and then you said that in the US working class earned less... it can't be both. The working class can't both make more then the middle class and less then the middle class"
10,"If she earns money from the work of others, then she is not working-class."
10,A professor would be middle class
10,Working class fashion
10,I swear I can see some ribs between her collar bones and breasts too.

10,Hahaha!! Marky Mark
10,"I saw! The ""clean"" ones 🤣"
10,Yeah this cracked me up too
10,"Just need to point out that David is correct and she is wrong. The idea that you're ""working class"" because some of your family are poor, and even worse, because you have an accent or your parents were poor before you were born will be the death of this country. Class is about your economic and political power **now** and your background or wider family are largely irrelevant."
10,Isn’t she a clothing designer now?
10,Marky Mark probably can’t even spell fiduciary responsibility.
10,He owns so many dealerships near me. Super annoying too. Rich people want their fingers in everything

10,Posh is rich but not upper class. UK society is divided very deeply and new money is looked down upon
10,I also want to be Beckham working class 😂
10,I would love to be the not upper class that she is 😂
10,Upper class for us and England are very different. It's not just money it's about heritage and genetics.

11,Its more like “the hideous”

12,She’s simultaneously talking down on the “working class” while also trying to be proud of it. Such mental gymnastics for the super wealthy especially those born into it. They feel more validated if people think they had to work for their wealth I guess? Coming from a household worth  million and now being worth  million is not as impressive as coming from poverty so I guess that’s why they do this.
12,Worth it
12,“And it was more complicated because my dad wasn’t really the driver.”
12,"He wasn't born worth half a billion, that's the point..."
12,Get a grip of yourself it's a joke.

12,They really had matching hair cuts
12,Sometimes the marriage is worth saving despite infidelity.

12,My guess is there's some octopus out there with sweet hair
12,% is a lot less than %

12,"Yeah, I was trying to think of a Sunak joke. But I guess he *is* the joke."
12,If the typos are intentional this is masterful troll work.
12,It's a joke
12,"people are making fun of her because of how tone deaf it is, not because of the cultural implications. ""we had money but had to really work to be part of the boys' club"" is not something most people have sympathy for."
12,I'll never understand why all the paparazii aren't arrested for harassment.
12,Do her legs not work or something?
12,I think his penance for that was sinking almost  million into her fashion empire as its never really made any money and had huge losses.
12,"Yeah, homegirl has a lot to be proud about 😂"
12,Also currently has these knockoffs 
12,They really are

12,Her hair here was perfection
12,Fair
12,What they really really want?
12,"She really is, bless her for sharing."
12,"So for the US, shows are usually around  min +  min of ads or  min +  min of ads. Approximately. It’s a lot of ads. Also the sound of commercials is much louder than the sound of shows, so it can be really obnoxious. There’s also the “so much content but nothing I want to watch” thing on our channels."
12,"hold on, sending this to my ex boyfriend i’ll brb 😂😂😂"

12,He really pressed the F
12,He’s talking about the sextuple
12,"We're not talking about that, though."
12,If you think this wasn't scripted..
12,"Not really she started with this in , people are calling her out now for it because she’s overdoing it"
12,Is it worth even trying to see it in the Houston area 🫠
12,That % not how business deals work.
12,Not to me. Not for a lot of people

12,people are still racist to people who aren’t white lol
12,"Wasn't it Park, Evra and Tevez? They had an unexpected friendship trio."

12,"It’s not even about wealth, it’s about a dick measuring contest."
12,"To be fair I think she meant it depends on when you are talking, when she was really young her father wasn't wealthy but later he was or at least enough to rent expensive cars"

13,I know. Why is it up voted?
13,Yea not sure I want the “c’s get degrees” crowd treating me.
13,"He is witty and funny, that's good-natured banter! He obviously enjoys time with his inlaws and feels confident enough to tease them like that."

13,"Oh Nooo😂 Don’t do that to me,lol. 
At least he’s not the ginger winger,😂"
13,It is a baked good with dairy and jam.  It is ALL good!
13,Not sure if Sbardila oula troussa...
13,In London we have a great market called Galaf Street. Don’t know if there’s something like that in Morocco? 🤔

14,That voice on him is a boner killer tho...
14,"she doesn't want people to think that she wasn't a hard worker and was just riding the wave and that literally anybody in her place could have ended up the way she did

14,"Nope, just black. 👻"
14,"I do a fair bit of written communication with people as part of my job and it would surprise you the amount of supposedly educated individuals, going by their academic titles, that fail at basic grammar.

14,Lol at that being probably higher than most of our total savings tho
14,I laughed a bit too hard at your misspelling (intentional or not) so thank you 😂
14,I think it’s very known how he still cheats and has a whole mistress. They are just such a brand they can’t separate.
14,Do folks still care about these people?
14,Is it just Rebecca Loos who they sort of discuss or some of the other alleged affairs too?
14,I don't think he's denying it. Its a known fact anyway. To the extent that the mistress went on a reality show just on this basis. He's focusing on the fallout because that's the question on the table.
14,she’s just casually flexing on all of us
14,"I’m honestly surprised his legs are so thin , not a complaint just an observation"
14,Can I see a pic of her in the same position
14,"Rebecca Loos out there saying ""he a'ight, voice grates tho."""
14,"I’m glad it’s not just me. He manages to pull them off against all odds, though. He probably gets given custom tailored CKs though 🤣"
14,"She’s right, tho."
14,"It's crazy to think that Betty White was originally considered for her part, right? Hard to imagine anyone but Rue McClanahan in that role."
14,Timothee Chalamet must right up your alley. Has that Victorian wasting disease on lock.

14,It's not right but it's okay ❤️
14,This is just goofy
14,I just want to cut my wedding cake with a sword
14,i deeply relate to that expression
14,I think it was Vivenne Westwood
14,I think about her scratching that T into her married boyfriend's back with her nail WAY too often 🤣
14,"By knowing the future, sometimes we are able to prevent it."
14,I'm starting to think people write that way just to irk other people.
14,Fergie from the Black Eyed Peas or Fergie from the Buckingham Palace?

14,You're right.
14,"Erm, Rebecca Loos anyone??"
14,"Big deal, she weighs probably ~kg"
14,why tho
14,I think that would be loyalty but okay
14,"If she forgave him, I'd think that's all that matters 🤷‍♀️"
14,Right?? The game on that one is formidable.
14,You’re right
14,That fact you think this is a performance is depressing
14,Except when one of band gets a solo gig.
14,Before or after he cheated with Rebecca loos?
14,"lets see him bench press his way out of this one

what a choad"
14,Markie was cooler when he cosplays a black rapper.
14,How did he get so buff then?  Even with PEDs it's still obvious he trains hard.
14,"Us carnys have to stick together, it's the carny code."
14,"I don't want to be rich, I just don't want to be in debt"
14,"It’s an exaggerated expression for a reason, although people will get to that point eventually if it gets bad enough."
14,"He sounds uneducated. It’s a fact not everyone has the same opportunities. That’s an excuse to blame the struggles people have, on the people having them."
14,A pirates dream- a sunken chest.
14,I think this was pre-boob job.

14,I think we have different definitions of what “athletic” means
14,What if someone sets you up with a volley from right next to you? That's as slow and predictable as it gets.
14,Sarah geller doesn’t sound right

14,This is just SOOOO greedy 💀
14,Hyvee is sponsoring him??? Literally why he’s not even from the midwest

14,Or they just want some sexual variety?
14,Plus the ego from having thousands of people throwing themselves at you. We don't get that as mere mortals.

14,Do you think he is still unfaithful now?
14,"I was getting that vibe as well, honestly"
14,I think what the commenter means is that it’s easier for celebrities to do what we mere mortals would do without the stress of access and covering tracks
14,it’s soooo crazy that that’s Hugo Succession

14,Who could blame him?

14,"Don't, they are with their birth moms (to the extent they exist). IMOP."
14,Tagging his own name with different spellings so his pics show up no matter what people  spell is a bit sad right? Even influencers don't do this
14,We should just spare him once in a while. I don’t think the  siblings are anyway likeable and well brought up so can’t do much about it.
14,He doesn't breathe in knockoff oxygen okay.
14,Fanatism/stanning/simping Call it whatever you want.
14,Lolol it's Mike's Place in Marshall! Sidenote: Marshall missed by one vote for the State Capital to Lansing.

14,"Honestly asking, what's the protocol for how these two would greet each other given their respective titles?"
14,"That's the whole point of the position Prince of Wales.  Since Albert, anyway."

14,A bit pretentious considering the state of the British Empire these days
14,Five is right out.
14,They just casted another  / people
14,"I hope so! And the Kung fu dugongs! And the crab, and Eyelashes...I just want them all! >.<"

16,Love them
16,Yes minister

16,Any marriage can last that long if you tolerate cheating.

16,That makes it even cuter 😂
16,"Nah, I think he’s being sincere, but in a jokey way."
16,I truly think sex and love need to be separated at times. Honesty and commitment are more valuable in my eyes.
16,That pretty much sums it up!
16,"I'm confident you will. It's important to focus on self improvement and self fulfillment so that when you do meet them you're prepared to be in a healthy relationship. Too often we think that a relationship will make us happy when the healthy thing is for the relationship to enrich us, not fix us."
16,Nah still embarrassing

16,The documentary on them was very good.
16,Yes
16,"I fell in love with them watching the docu. I always liked them, but the documentary showed them in a new light. Would it bother you to elaborate on what Bowers claims? Unfortunately, if we consider him a good source for the Whaagrkles, we have to consider him truthful also in this."

18,Messi incoming on loan from Inter Miami
18,"People use PSG as a stick to beat Qatar while conveniently forgetting what PSG was before Qatar and it is to Qatar. 

PSG was a struggling club before Qatar and if Qatar leaves they will fade into irrelevance again.  And to Qatar, PSG was a pet project. An initial foray into football when they started to cultivate the idea of hosting a world cup. Even the nature of the signings they made and the kind of sponsorship deals they sign is indicative of that. To you PSG might be a failure but no PSG fan thinks so and Qatar definitely doesn't think so."

A sua vida inteira desde criança deve ser imersa naquele esporte e na imagem do seu pai/mãe famoso, deve ser difícil não desenvolver nem um pouco do sonho de você também ser um atleta igual

Esse da thread parece ter percebido relativamente cedo que a carreira não é pra ele, mas tem vários que escolhem viver uma vida de atleta mesmo, só sem o sucesso dos pais. Não é como se fosse nenhum crime também."
18,mas foi por isso que ele já aposentou?
18,"Dos quatro filhos dos dois, esse foi o que fez a façanha de nascer feio."
18,"Ser jogador de futebol sendo filho de jogador deveria ser crime, maioria dá em nada, de  o cara conta  ou  que dá certo.

Tipo Thiago, Rafinha, Marcus Thuram o outro Thuram, é foda."
18,"Ser jogador de futebol em geral não dá em nada, de milhares conta um penca que dá certo. O filho de jogador pelo menos não vai perder por capital ou falta de mentoria, e possivelmente tem alguma vantagem genética (mas nada garantido). As provações e treinos que fizeram de seus pais grandes atletas em primeiro lugar (muitas vezes, ironicamente, a superação da falta de recursos) podem não ser replicados."
18,Vai me dizer que o Edinho nao deu certo? Kkkkk
18,O goleiro dinamarquês Scheimel foi melhor que o pai. Acho que deve ser uma das únicas exceções.
