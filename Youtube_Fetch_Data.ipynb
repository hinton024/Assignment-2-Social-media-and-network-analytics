I think, alot of the women in this country (England) adore him, which is good<br>for him. David has had an easy life .true or not true? This is the World today, a life of ease. I am not saying I don&#39;t like him but he seems a bit arrogant,<br>and too full of himself. I use to play football at school believe it or not now I do boxing and plan to travel to Mexico to Guadalajara to spend time there, I will<br>return with a suntan. David being british is in the right country for it, innit. Its not what you do, its where your born. Am from Jamaica, and am proud of that.<br>Yours Respectfully<br>Mr Francesca Al Kray.<br>29th October 1969.\n",

      "- Schönen Abend. David war ein Fussballstar, jeder wollte was von ihm... Kann gut verstehen, dass ihn das überfordert hat. Wenn man berühmt ist, wann  wo und wann kann man Mensch sein. Einfach Mensch sein zu können ist glaube ich für jeden Menschen wichtig. David hat sich und sein Glück mit seiner Frau Victoria und seinen Kindern gefunden. Die Netflixserie zeigt David als Fussballer und auch als echten Mensch, das finde ich wunderschoen. Schönen Abend. L.g. Silvia Winkler, Tirol, 🇦🇹\n",

      "- <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUVNbJMWi_c&amp;t=45\">0:45</a>  Sir Alex Ferguson saying, &quot;Well it changed him&quot;. Hilarious 😂😆\n",
      "- Great doc<br>Just finished it<br>As an American , I knew him as the soccer player that married Posh Spice, whichever one she was. lol. <br>Obviously I became more familiar with him once he came to America. I never knew about his red card and how his own fans treated him. That was brutal!!<br>But he stood strong and came out on top. And he seem like a real cool dude. <br>Great doc!!!!\n",
      "- I do wonder how he would have turned out if he HADN&#39;t met Victoria.\n",
      "- I just finished watching this and I must say I absolutely loved it! Beckham was a legend! They were my fav couple aswell but yeah David has a pure heart and was passionate about his career.  I didn’t like how England were against him made him feel so small I don’t know how he pulled through and still kept playing he is brilliant! Like always David Beckham is a LEGEND!\n",
      "- No\n",
      "- Don’t think David should have let Alex Ferguson talk on his documentary as he still clearly holds a grudge against him. He never wanted David to have a life other than football. A bit pathetic really! 😒\n",
      "- I just keep hearing the Beckham TikTok song\n",
      "- That campaign against Beckham after the worldcup was an absolute disgrace. To abuse a person by a whole nation... If the English can be bullies, they will. Absolute disgrace.\n",
      "- Just watched this and this is why I tell my son you have to be careful who you fall in love with “Victoria from the beginning didn’t care about the game and didn’t care to lead or sacrifice her own career but yet was manipulative period “I dislike her ways “you can tell his mom don’t like her she tolerates her\n",
      "- Bananas straight to your door step\n",
      "- Ur bride was trying to pull focus on her wearing purple on her wedding\n",
      "- Fantastic documentary,I have nothing but huge respect for David and Victoria, my heart sank watching the vitriolic reaction of the fans . Dreadful treatment and very cowardly behaviour towards a young couple. Wishing them both a long happy life with their family….\n",
      "- From a person who has no interest in sports... this was a phenomenally produced docuseries. I was riveted. In the &#39;90s and early &#39;00s, I had an idea of who these people were, and this doc flipped the script. Cheers to them being happily married so long, through good times and bad, and raising decent children. Beckham was a phenomenal talent and a hard worker, which is rare these days. I had respect for how he kept showing up, even when the fans hated him and Madrid cut him and made him train apart from the rest of the team - he SHOWED UP AND TRAINED anyway. That&#39;s character. Hats off to Fisher Stevens -  this is the most watchable doc I&#39;ve seen in a long time.\n",
      "- Wow, this is the meaning of a perfect life full of drama. David and Posh went through a lot and they lived to tell the story. this Docy had me in tears at times.\n",
      "- WoW, there is no excuse for treating them this way.  England is full of horrid ppl.\n",
      "- the bestest\n",
      "- Amazing documentary ❤\n",
      "- I watched this. It was pretty good. I can honestly say afterwards, F all of England on how they treated him after that red card!\n",
      "- This was a brilliant doco fell in love with this family so true and real.. <br>Unlike the grifters beckhams have way more class and morals 😍\n",
      "- Dude is a machine\n",
      "- Wnat netflix to make a documentary on Maldini man who devoted his whole career for AC milan ❤✨️\n",
      "- I would watch this over and over for the cuteness of their love affair! May not be a humble beginnings for both as they love signatures even long time ago but already there as a power couple! 😂 It’s hilarious that his payday during his beginning was not even enough for his love of shopping! lol <br><br>I’ll couldn’t even watch Harry and MeAgain docu series on Netflix as they bored me for nothing to begin with- D&amp;V has a unique first love story and such a humble of where their love stories started- stardom, WCup and world tour for the SGirls, they made it there until Brooklyn came. Such a lovely and cute journey of their love and career, which MeAgain for sure will fly high if she ever experienced this stardom and tour! Wondering how would she act more than how she is right now? 🤢\n",
      "- What a Documentary, David Beckam is a true Legend ♥ ♥ ♥\n",
      "- Take ur Britisher ass and go home or else I will get you kicked to send you to Mexico\n",
      "- To be honest, I really loved this documentary. I don’t even like soccer that much but what I learned about David Beckham’s life, taught me a lot about human resilience. I remember him and a posh Spice as one of the most beautiful couples in the world. Nevertheless, I saw a really, human, down to earth view of them through this fabulous documentary . I actually feel empathy with David when he was rejected and hated for a mistake that took years to be forgotten. I have felt that and can relate. I admire him in a different way now. Not just for his soccer talent or looks but for his strength and bravery. Always a gentleman through rough times. I am a big fan of David and Victoria more now than before. She is also brave, she went through thick and thin. Wow. Amazing couple and beautiful family. I can’t  not see David’s eyes. His kindness in them tells us the big heart he has. I feel him. At a such young age, he felt the cruelness of a bitter society that is quick to judge and slow to forgive.\n",

      "- The match David reffered to was the secong leg of the 2003 CL quarter finals at Old Trafford vs Real Madrid. The score was Man U 4-3 Real and it&#39;s still today the greatest football game I&#39;ve ever seen. The original Ronaldo&#39;s hat-trick earned him a rare standing ovation from the whole stadium and David&#39;s late brace won Man U the game but were out off the tournament due to a 6-5 goal aggregate. Allegedly, Roman Abrahamovic attended the game and was so inspired he would buy Chelsea the following summer and the rest is history ...\n",

It’s not inspirational once we find out the truth it’s an insult to those who truly do go through these hard times which is most people on this earth.\n",

      "- Greatest crosser and set piece taker ever in my opinion, helped MILLIONS learn and love the game, and also had some incredibly underrated stats. Leave a like if you enjoyed! 🙏 ❤\n",
      "- People only called him overrated because he transcended the sport (due to looks) and became something of a cultural / fashion icon -- even more so after marrying one of the Spice Girls.    If he didn&#39;t have model good looks, and if he didn&#39;t marry a famous singer, he would be regarded as what he actually was -- an elite footballer in his position.\n",
      "- Massively underrated there is not a player who is still playing that can pass a ball as good as beckham\n",
      "- Awesome   player\n",
      "- Name a single other player that was good enough to play for Manchester United, Real Madrid, AC Milan and PSG!\n",
      "- True that when Beckham was on his peak there were playing the finest players of history compared to todays that there is only a handful number of real world class players\n",
      "- Super footballer 💯💯💯💫\n",
      "- In the emergency situation of England and Man Utd David Beckham always showed most of the time. He had a different class. People must understand Beckham is a separate point of view.\n",
      "- <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5x1gimRwUk&amp;t=661\">11:01</a>  pausé\n",
      "- He&#39;s a legend and icon of football and pop culture, I think after leaving England for Spain changed the narrative and we started to see fans appreciate him\n",
      "- him and carlos together was crazy man\n",
      "- He is a legend. If you are true football fan without bias, you will know his skill is crazy. He is the best crosser and passer.\n",
      "- 🎉Just a reminder y’all! John 14:6- “Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.” Jesus loves and wants a relationship with us, let us use our time wisely to get to know Him before He comes 🫶🏾\n",
      "- I should thank him for the many balls he gave me😂😂😂\n",
      "- imagine David played in modern football....imagine him playing for Mourinho....a player that can score from anywhere...and deadly pin point ball to a team mate...\n",
      "- So he scores a few free kicks and corner kicks immediately his status gets labelled as world class 😂😂😂 COME ON !!!<br>this guy was a celebrity  thats it  ! Thers nothing special about him. <br><br>Special  talent wer <br>Nani <br>Tevez<br>Giggs <br>Scholes <br>Rooney <br>Ronaldo\n",
      "- more like, underrated....LEGEND\n",
      "- - EVERY player wishes they were David Beckham... and EVERY haters wishes there were David Beckham.\n",
      "- If you compare the era in which he played he wouldn&#39;t make the top 20 as well but still he gets more recognition just because of his good looks.\n",
      "- Bend It Like Beckham. That’s all I have to say\n",
      "- Anyone who reckons Beckham was overrated needs to follow a simpler sport as they clearly don’t understand football. <br><br>I’d suggest Snakes &amp; Ladders.\n",
      "- Paul Scholes from Midd.😊\n",
      "- Overrated\n",
      "- David Beckham is an all time great!!! end of story, modern football is shit!\n",
      "- Legend\n",
      "- Vince carter is similar\n",
      "- Brilliant player\n",
      "- If a player like Beckham existed today, Real Madrid, City, Inter Milan, Bayern Munchen, PSG, literally everybody would chase him. He would have price easily above 100m $ these days. Today football is about long pass accuracy. Beckham surely one of the best player ever exist with that skill.\n",
      "- My Dad saw Beckham play in his prime, I saw Beckham play after that when his celebrity had eclipsed his work on the pitch...either way both of us agree he is a legend because he was still sought after by clubs like AC Milan and PSG...in his mid to late 30s...that&#39;s not normal even now and I think its a testament to what he could give on the pitch. Plus when absolute legends of the game who have actually played with him speak so highly of him...I&#39;ll take that any day over someone judging from the stands\n",
      "- Is his wife overrated?\n",

      "- Señor David Beckham jugar con elegancia es una virtud....Mi hijo luce en un traje igual que Ud....el quiso ser arquero desde lo 3 años ....Me dijo... cuando sea grande voy a ser arquero y yo le dije: primero tenes que ir a la Universidad.....En unos meses recibe su titulo Ingeniero ....Siempre encontro tiempo para estar en el arco de los equipos que lo invitan a jugar...<br>Se tira por la pelota como un profesional ...al principio llegaba todo lastimado .......Despues se volvió hábil para caer......vuela por el aire en forma horizontal para agarrar una pelota...se tira de lado....el se comporta como un profesional...Su actitud es la misma en casa....en su trabajo y sus amigos......Mi hijo se llama como Ud.....un abrazo para Ud y su familia.....\n",

      "- In pochi lo sanno, ma David Beckham soffre di asma fin dalla tenera età, nonostante questo è riuscito a diventare uno dei migliori della storia. Oggi ho scoperto di essere asmatico, però sapendo questo ho capito che chiunque con qualsiasi problema, se ha un sogno e lo vuole realizzare con il massimo impegno, niente può fermarlo. Io ho un sogno ed è quello di diventare un calciatore professionista proprio come lui e ci proverò fino alla fine❤️❤️\n",

      "Description: David Beckham joined forces with the Prince of Wales to celebrate smashing a £15 million target to replace London’s ageing air ambulance helicopters. William invited the former England football captain to get into the cockpit of one of the two new aircraft that will help ensure the vital service for Londoners continues for years to come. Beckham met the prince at RAF Northolt in west London, where the two new helicopters were on display next to the aircraft they replaced. \n",

      "- Not a big issues.  In South London our was launch some years ago we even have a Helipod on the 9th floor of out hospital\n",
      "- From the Giving Evidence website: <br><br>“As well as finding no evidence that Royals bring revenue to their patronee charities, we also found no reason that donors should assume that a charity with a Royal patronage outperforms its peers. Take air ambulances. The UK has 21 air ambulance charities, each serving a different ‘patch’. The ones with senior Royal patrons are: Cornwall (Camilla: Duchess of Cornwall), London (William: who lives in London), Wiltshire (Camilla, who has a house in neighbouring Gloucestershire), and Yorkshire (Andrew: Duke of York). It seems likely that these selections are driven less by quality than by history and geography.<br><br>We found no evidence that a concentration of Royal patronages of charities in a geographic area increases the generosity of people in that area. (We compared English regions on (i) the number of Royal patronages they have, and (ii) the proportion of people who have given recently). And looking internationally, we found no evidence that a resident Royal family makes a nation more generous. In short, we looked from many angles, and did not find evidence of a beneficial effect from any of them.”\n",
