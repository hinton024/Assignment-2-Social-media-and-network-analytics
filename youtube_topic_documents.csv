0,No one has ever been able to consistently recreate how well Beckham could strike a ball. <br><br>We&#;ve seen players who are great and striking a ball and taking dead ball situations to another level but not on the same level as Beckham. <br><br>Roberto Carlos was a great strike of a ball but wasn&#;t as consistently precise as Beckham. Flawless technique.
0,Haaland looks younger now compare to when he faced Beckham
0,"Becks was a good FK taker at best. A very commercial gimmick that he&#;s known for it, when several others were better and no one even knows it. <br><br>Like all things England, his ability has been overrated orders of magnitude."

0,"I’ll bet one of the A-listers for Beckham’s show is Tom Cruise, as he watched him playing for Madrid and he’s friends with him. Beckham mania in the late ’s and ’s was quite the thing to see."
0,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igmUnkxfBw&amp;t="">:</a>. Why make an animation of the goal he&#;s describing instead of showing the clip? Give people a chance to see what he&#;s talking about."

1,"Schönen Abend. David war ein Fussballstar, jeder wollte was von ihm... Kann gut verstehen, dass ihn das überfordert hat. Wenn man berühmt ist, wann  wo und wann kann man Mensch sein. Einfach Mensch sein zu können ist glaube ich für jeden Menschen wichtig. David hat sich und sein Glück mit seiner Frau Victoria und seinen Kindern gefunden. Die Netflixserie zeigt David als Fussballer und auch als echten Mensch, das finde ich wunderschoen. Schönen Abend. L.g. Silvia Winkler, Tirol, 🇦🇹"
1,Loved it ❤
1,"Sehr gute Doku! Wer Fussball liebt, liebt diese Doku. DB wirkt beim erzählen recht müde und etwas traurig hier und da. Toll fand ich all die Stationen die er ging, den Erfolg , den Schmerz, das Zurückkommen. Er hat echt eine Menge durchgemacht, alles voller Leidenschaft ob auf dem Feld oder Zuhause. Der hat für beides gebrannt. Guter Typ."
1,"... die englischen Fans sollten sich schämen, nach so einer roten Karte ihn dermaßen an den Pranger zu stellen und sogar zu drohen!!!<br>PFUIIII!!!!!!!"

15,Not yet but I saw there’s a loyalty program too. Earn points for playing and get exclusive rewards.
15,"It&#;s funny how he became so famous outside the pitch, that he somehow got underrated as a footballer"
15,"It blows my mind how many people (mostly the youths, probably because they were too young or not even born yet) who have forgotten/don&#;t know truly how amazing this man was. He wasn&#;t just a good looking guy. England has produced some truly great players, but during his prime he was arguably the greatest player playing in the world, at least top . He was a wizard when it came to taking free kicks, and he knew how to deliver the ball perfectly to a forward who had a little pace."
15,"And yet, he never won anything for his country."

16,Legends
16,"Legends recognise legends, icons, respect icons"
16,Both legends ❤❤
16,Beck’s absolutely mugged off the MLS. Like playing against children. <br>How many times did he put it on a plate for Donovan and he fucked it up 🤣
16,I think Trent can do all these crosses and pass just like him. For me TAA is a masterclass!
16, inches bending left
16, inch bending left...   Beckham

16,"Bro, i think ra’s new ads show their commitment to quality.  love seeing their dedication."
16,"The cricket vibes at ra are stronger with Finch, man. It&#;s like having a captain for our betting team!"
16,Finch&#;s partnership with ra? A perfect match. Brings credibility and loads of fun!
16,"Finch&#;s strategies on ra are spot on, bro. Betting on cricket just got a lot smarter!"

17,Oh nice! I was actually looking at their welcome bonus. It&#;s pretty generous. Got some extra cash to play with
17,"Ball english was always going to his left, goalies right. Just guard half the goal on those free kicks..."
17, UCL Winners And  UCL Dreamers 🤣🤣🤣
17,Becks is simply a boss! I&#;d vote for him to be king of england
17,King Henry and Becks then theres the other lot on the panel😂
17,F... Fischer! Becks was a GigaChad with the Be Honest moment!
17,"Here you realise why he never became a moviestar... His voice is just so soft and bright, and such a cheeky accent, that he could NEVER have played any cool roles. Despite him looking like Clint Eastwood."
17,"What a legend, the Greece goal actually made me cry watching it again. What a moment for an England supporter"
17,That’s actually insane. You can see a ball magically appear to the right of the screen after the second ball is kicked and before the camera moves to frame the third shot.
17,Mermi atsan bu kadar düzdün vuramazsın aq adam ağır nişancı
17,Exposing the pride of Becks
17,"Bu kadın güldüğünde ve gülümsediğinde çok güzeldi, gülümsemediğinde ise çok çirkin 🤦‍♂️ bu çok ilginç 🤔"
17,Ripd is King
17,Rip fox😂
17,I can fell the moment
17,"They just didnt realise he scored a goal, they thought the ball had to go over the bar."
17,thers nothing you can do about that.
17,What a goal!
17,That is so strange

18,You still smell lovely....Micah you fool 😂😂😂😂
18,"Why DB doesn’t want Micah and Carra to the show ? If cbs crew is important enough for DB to visit, the same must apply to the other way round."
18,Micah is a pure happy soul.. I always look forward to him talk ... So lovely 😄😄😄😄😄
18,HE ALSO CHEATED ON HIS WIFE. SEND HIM TO NY FOR A TRIAL.
18,Holy shit! Bad Ass
18,It’s never gonna get old😂😂😂😂

19,"Totally And if you&#;re into crash games, they have daily bonuses. I won some free plays yesterday"
19,As mentioned &quot;A goal you will see over and over again&quot; <br><br>Still seeing it after all these years 🙇‍♂️
19,What Becks attempts sound like what Rogan does when he watches UFC with his pals.
19,"<b>&quot;You guys got honey, ha ha!&quot;</b><br>That&#;s why she&#;s the perfect fit."
19,BCFC mentioned 🔵⚪️
19,I love the way Kate said &quot;ohhhh you guys got honey&quot;😂😂😂😂😂low key
19,&quot;you guys got honey&quot;   Love Kate.  She&#;s the best!
19,"# Absolutely lovely interview! # how is Sean at &quot;Inter Miami&quot; (in Ft. Lauderdale), under studio lights, wearing a suede jacket, eating hot wings and NOT breaking a sweat?!?🥵🥴 Either we just met AI generated &quot;Sean&quot; or Sean Evans is just THE G.O.A.T."
19,When beckham said &quot;you can.&quot; i believe him.
19,I haven’t watched this show in a few years. I’m surprised the host is still doing this show after how many wings he has to eat. I’d be tired of it by now
19,&quot;I don&#;t know why my nose is on fire&quot; we litteraly watching him touching his nose x times after he grab the wings.
19,I’m not seeing what the hype is about with him
19,Congrats honey💙💙😉

19,I always remember that Greece game because our rivals tried to banter us afterwards saying that we could only manage a draw against them and then two years later they went and won the euros 😂
19,did you guys realize the first one the commentator was talking just like in dls games?
19,Impossible to believe that the Greece goal was  years ago !!! It feels like yesterday !
19,The &#;it&#;s even easier&#; always gets me.  How is doing something  times easier than doing it once?  Even if it is the simplest task in the world like blinking your eyes.  Doing it  times can&#;t be &#;even easier&#; than doing it once.
19, years later watching at . speed😂😂 &quot;Baallll&quot;
19,Hes got some vodka in his pepsi😅
19,&quot;Dave it is&quot; 😂
19,Champions: Return To Arms as outfit she got on <br>😂😂😂 i thought that was Blood Rayne

19,And now he owns inter Miami
19,Is the commentator choking up?
19, years ago! Seems like this only happened yesterday
19,It was in  I remember
19,To irl wilson...what the commentator said was &quot;Give that man a knighthood&quot;....A knighthood in UK means a person can add the title &quot;Sir&quot; or &quot;Dame&quot; to their name.
19,"@luca 
 He says &quot;Give that man a knighthood&quot; But it does sound like item when you go back and listen to it :P"
19,I remember this goal like it was yesterday&lt;
19, Years❤

19,"Как русские говорят ,&quot;ТАЛАНТ НЕ ПРОПЬЕШЬ &quot;,он останется на всю жизнь"
