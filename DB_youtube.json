            "One word .....Greece .",
            "It&#39;s funny how he became so famous outside the pitch, that he somehow got underrated as a footballer",
            "Legend",
            "It blows my mind how many people (mostly the youths, probably because they were too young or not even born yet) who have forgotten/don&#39;t know truly how amazing this man was. He wasn&#39;t just a good looking guy. England has produced some truly great players, but during his prime he was arguably the greatest player playing in the world, at least top 3. He was a wizard when it came to taking free kicks, and he knew how to deliver the ball perfectly to a forward who had a little pace.",
            "English say Beckham &quot;top tier legend&quot; but the rest of the world regard him to be a pretty average player.",

            "Great at free kicks, but the quality and quantity of his open play goals is nothing compared to Steve Gerrard.",
            "If only his kids had his talent",
            "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTpTVqJX8ho&amp;t=43\">0:43</a> Was he trying to score aiming the towel?",
            "And yet, he never won anything for his country.",
            "See how exciting it is when players actually run withe the ball.......",
            "Spears montain😊",
            "Becks was a good FK taker at best. A very commercial gimmick that he&#39;s known for it, when several others were better and no one even knows it. <br><br>Like all things England, his ability has been overrated orders of magnitude.",
            "GOAT",
            "i wish England had Won a WC with Beckham,,  not even a soccer fan,,,  but he was insparational,,, and got some terrible calls in WCups",

I think, alot of the women in this country (England) adore him, which is good<br>for him. David has had an easy life .true or not true? This is the World today, a life of ease. I am not saying I don&#39;t like him but he seems a bit arrogant,<br>and too full of himself. I use to play football at school believe it or not now I do boxing and plan to travel to Mexico to Guadalajara to spend time there, I will<br>return with a suntan. David being british is in the right country for it, innit. Its not what you do, its where your born. Am from Jamaica, and am proud of that.<br>Yours Respectfully<br>Mr Francesca Al Kray.<br>29th October 1969.",

            "Schönen Abend. David war ein Fussballstar, jeder wollte was von ihm... Kann gut verstehen, dass ihn das überfordert hat. Wenn man berühmt ist, wann  wo und wann kann man Mensch sein. Einfach Mensch sein zu können ist glaube ich für jeden Menschen wichtig. David hat sich und sein Glück mit seiner Frau Victoria und seinen Kindern gefunden. Die Netflixserie zeigt David als Fussballer und auch als echten Mensch, das finde ich wunderschoen. Schönen Abend. L.g. Silvia Winkler, Tirol, 🇦🇹",

I never knew about his red card and how his own fans treated him. That was brutal!!<br>But he stood strong and came out on top. And he seem like a real cool dude. <br>Great doc!!!!",

            "I just finished watching this and I must say I absolutely loved it! Beckham was a legend! They were my fav couple aswell but yeah David has a pure heart and was passionate about his career.  I didn’t like how England were against him made him feel so small I don’t know how he pulled through and still kept playing he is brilliant! Like always David Beckham is a LEGEND!",
            "No",
            "Don’t think David should have let Alex Ferguson talk on his documentary as he still clearly holds a grudge against him. He never wanted David to have a life other than football. A bit pathetic really! 😒",

            "That campaign against Beckham after the worldcup was an absolute disgrace. To abuse a person by a whole nation... If the English can be bullies, they will. Absolute disgrace.",
            "Just watched this and this is why I tell my son you have to be careful who you fall in love with “Victoria from the beginning didn’t care about the game and didn’t care to lead or sacrifice her own career but yet was manipulative period “I dislike her ways “you can tell his mom don’t like her she tolerates her",

            "Fantastic documentary,I have nothing but huge respect for David and Victoria, my heart sank watching the vitriolic reaction of the fans . Dreadful treatment and very cowardly behaviour towards a young couple. Wishing them both a long happy life with their family….",
            "From a person who has no interest in sports... this was a phenomenally produced docuseries. I was riveted. In the &#39;90s and early &#39;00s, I had an idea of who these people were, and this doc flipped the script. Cheers to them being happily married so long, through good times and bad, and raising decent children. Beckham was a phenomenal talent and a hard worker, which is rare these days. I had respect for how he kept showing up, even when the fans hated him and Madrid cut him and made him train apart from the rest of the team - he SHOWED UP AND TRAINED anyway. That&#39;s character. Hats off to Fisher Stevens -  this is the most watchable doc I&#39;ve seen in a long time.",
            "Wow, this is the meaning of a perfect life full of drama. David and Posh went through a lot and they lived to tell the story. this Docy had me in tears at times.",

            "I would watch this over and over for the cuteness of their love affair! May not be a humble beginnings for both as they love signatures even long time ago but already there as a power couple! 😂 It’s hilarious that his payday during his beginning was not even enough for his love of shopping! lol <br><br>I’ll couldn’t even watch Harry and MeAgain docu series on Netflix as they bored me for nothing to begin with- D&amp;V has a unique first love story and such a humble of where their love stories started- stardom, WCup and world tour for the SGirls, they made it there until Brooklyn came. Such a lovely and cute journey of their love and career, which MeAgain for sure will fly high if she ever experienced this stardom and tour! Wondering how would she act more than how she is right now? 🤢",
            "What a Documentary, David Beckam is a true Legend ♥ ♥ ♥",
            "Take ur Britisher ass and go home or else I will get you kicked to send you to Mexico",
            "To be honest, I really loved this documentary. I don’t even like soccer that much but what I learned about David Beckham’s life, taught me a lot about human resilience. I remember him and a posh Spice as one of the most beautiful couples in the world. Nevertheless, I saw a really, human, down to earth view of them through this fabulous documentary . I actually feel empathy with David when he was rejected and hated for a mistake that took years to be forgotten. I have felt that and can relate. I admire him in a different way now. Not just for his soccer talent or looks but for his strength and bravery. Always a gentleman through rough times. I am a big fan of David and Victoria more now than before. She is also brave, she went through thick and thin. Wow. Amazing couple and beautiful family. I can’t  not see David’s eyes. His kindness in them tells us the big heart he has. I feel him. At a such young age, he felt the cruelness of a bitter society that is quick to judge and slow to forgive.",
            "it popped on netflix and i was like why not? i was hooked",
            "It wasn&#39;t a matter of luck that he played for such great clubs. Man Utd, Real Madrid, Milan, PSG. Especially in Milan, he went on as a substitute and was able to change THE WHOLE GAME, next to such talented players, and imagine that he was past his prime!!! One of the BEST PLAYERS OF ALL TIME IN FOOTBALL. It&#39;s really sad that he did never get a Ballon D&#39; OR. I think he finished second  at sometime, but it is really bad.",

No one will repeat the distance he went in football ever.<br><br>He have done really well in and off the pitch. He still giving something to football even after he retired, he created a new football club where the best player ever (in the pitch) played for him now.",

            "A stunning and inspiring  documentary. I&#39;ve  adored the couple for decades  though I barely  knew much about them apart from their media image. Love them more now. Such strong, humble, loving and resilient people",
            "Super 7star football player David Beckham",
            "I’m watching episode 2 right now and feel so much empathy for what David went through. Crazy how horribly he was treated — over a game. Sometimes you really wonder how so many humans can be so incredibly vile and vindictive toward one another. I found it disgusting how he was treated. He was a 23 year old. He’s 47 now and still dealing with the guilt and self-loathing. It’s heartbreaking, really. I hope his mental health is getting better now.",
            "Sehr gute Doku! Wer Fussball liebt, liebt diese Doku. DB wirkt beim erzählen recht müde und etwas traurig hier und da. Toll fand ich all die Stationen die er ging, den Erfolg , den Schmerz, das Zurückkommen. Er hat echt eine Menge durchgemacht, alles voller Leidenschaft ob auf dem Feld oder Zuhause. Der hat für beides gebrannt. Guter Typ.",
            "Wonderful documentary. I watched all episodes back to back.<br>He was a phenomenal footballer and worked hard to achieve.",
            "This was so well done, because I don&#39;t know or care about football and found it really interesting. Lots of humor but also some honest emotions. His career really was a rollecoaster.",
            "I have just started watching this and I can&#39;t believe his own country turned on him and that horrible disgusting huddle blamed him even though it&#39;s a team sport.  I am so angry and I don&#39;t watch football.  I&#39;m a Kiwi and watch Rugby.  But this is just disgusting,  english people have nothing but flippin nastiness and don&#39;t get me started on that disgusting argentinian person who faked the fall, that team are cheaters from the beginning.    And no, you don&#39;t deserve capital letters, just sickening.  Manchester United thank you very much.  I haven&#39;t made it past the second episode am too distraught right now.",

His red card incident was just an excuse for a lot of the so called fans to empty out their frustration that they already had towards him imo. Bunch of cowards.",
            "This is how a documentary about sports person should be made. I don&#39;t know what kind of documentary did cristiano ronaldo made few years back.",
            "I loved this documentary....wow !!! Such respect....what a life ❤",
            "1:15 PM 11/20/2023  Didnt watch it all.  I had to stop because...  anyways.  I like these Netflix documentaries.  How did Beckham get penalized during World Cup but Argentinas top player didnt?  If I remember correctly Argentina pushed or did something to Beckham first?  I would have told David dont relate soccer to US Army as infantry.  Soccer comes first before family and relationships is what it sounded like in the episode.  Its just soccer but either way Beckham is a professional sports player.  England used him as that model image which I related to movies with boxing like how Soviets used Ivan Drago in Rocky 4 which I thought was cool.  This is just my take on all of this once you go professional in &quot;sports&quot; but I would have told Beckham I hope you can take a joke cus thats how I looked at the World Cup when you got penalized.  They push you that far with everyone hoping you wont tap out being that role model image (thats what happens when you go that far and become this celebrity image).  FOR THE LOVE OF THE SPORT (???).  I dont watch professional sports especially back in the day but Beckham probably carried the team in alot of games.",
            "One of the best tv shows i&#39;ve watched. The story, the cinematography, the ending, it was all perfect.",
            "Just finished Figos netflix...<br>NOW IM WATCHING YOURS! <br>PREPARE TO GET ROASTED 🔥",
            "Due to his celebrity status many has undermined or brush past the fact that David Beckham has 1 of Best comeback in football history. Imagine being the most hated man in your own country being yelled at, spitted on and vilified like ultimate villain most would not be able to take it, but he persevere, stay resilient and work hard to get back on the right track, that is one inspiring story that all of us can learn from. My late dad loved him for that very reasons",

Allegedly, Roman Abrahamovic attended the game and was so inspired he would buy Chelsea the following summer and the rest is history ...",

            "People only called him overrated because he transcended the sport (due to looks) and became something of a cultural / fashion icon -- even more so after marrying one of the Spice Girls.    If he didn&#39;t have model good looks, and if he didn&#39;t marry a famous singer, he would be regarded as what he actually was -- an elite footballer in his position.",

            "Awesome   player",
            "Name a single other player that was good enough to play for Manchester United, Real Madrid, AC Milan and PSG!",
            "True that when Beckham was on his peak there were playing the finest players of history compared to todays that there is only a handful number of real world class players",
            "Super footballer 💯💯💯💫",
            "In the emergency situation of England and Man Utd David Beckham always showed most of the time. He had a different class. People must understand Beckham is a separate point of view.",

            "him and carlos together was crazy man",
            "He is a legend. If you are true football fan without bias, you will know his skill is crazy. He is the best crosser and passer.",
            "🎉Just a reminder y’all! John 14:6- “Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.” Jesus loves and wants a relationship with us, let us use our time wisely to get to know Him before He comes 🫶🏾",

            "If a player like Beckham existed today, Real Madrid, City, Inter Milan, Bayern Munchen, PSG, literally everybody would chase him. He would have price easily above 100m $ these days. Today football is about long pass accuracy. Beckham surely one of the best player ever exist with that skill.",
            "My Dad saw Beckham play in his prime, I saw Beckham play after that when his celebrity had eclipsed his work on the pitch...either way both of us agree he is a legend because he was still sought after by clubs like AC Milan and PSG...in his mid to late 30s...that&#39;s not normal even now and I think its a testament to what he could give on the pitch. Plus when absolute legends of the game who have actually played with him speak so highly of him...I&#39;ll take that any day over someone judging from the stands",
            "Is his wife overrated?",
            "Beckham was a great player you can’t be a first team starter for Madrid man united and Milan if you suck thats literally the 3 biggest teams in the 3 biggest leagues in his prime England captain with 115 caps when England had arguably the most midfield talent in the world in gerrard scholes lampard also who has better accuracy with free kicks and crossing ? If you say he’s overrated your just hating",

            "Beckham overrated???? Please stop watching football",
            "Just the opposite. He is greatly underrated. He won everywhere he went and elevated every team he was on. He was one of the best crossers and free kick takers in history. And his work ethic was legendary. He was a joy to watch. And no one watching him as a teen thought anyone but he was the best player in his league. And one of the top across all leagues. Looking back it’s astonishing how such a great looking superstar was also so talented. Everything he touched turned and is still turning to gold.",
            "Why do people find him overrated? His accurate free kicks, crosses and long passes, are better than anyone&#39;s",
            "take PIrlo&#39;s skill and put it on an ATHLETE ahead of its time, dude was running on average 14 km every game, this years record in EPL is 13 km, and Beckham was running 14 km on average per match in the 90&#39;s 30 years ago where people were not even close to what we have now, at his famous England vs Greece match, ofc he scored iconic clutch free kick, but he run 16 km that game, he was everywhere, and he was so clutch, mentality, skills and athletic ability of a superstar, if hed played today he would play like Kroos sitting deep, controlling the game from midfield, building the attack, and for sure he would be a superatar at that position",
            "Overrated....Great  at free kicks,",
            "People saying beckham is overrated know nothing about footbal or just watched highlights vidoe or i don&#39;t know, i watched his since i was kid &amp; i can say that he is one of the legends of football!!! people who hate him are just peole who envy him for being handsome, a star &amp; rich!!! so when they want to mock him they tell you &quot;he is overrated&quot; &quot;he is just a pop star&quot; but i swear they never watched a single match of him.",
            "United legend but not an all the timer imo",
            "Beckham is far more clear than KDB .. I love KDB he&#39;s very good but Beckham us like Zizou. When you have him in the team the other players around him suddenly become better.",
            "He is a legends wherever he go, I can&#39;t say that he or KDB who is better just their styles are different. But for set piece, long cross and vision Devid is better",
            "The people saying shit about Beckham in the comments of videos like saying De Bruyne shits all over him are literal children that weren&#39;t even alive when Becks was playing through his best years. They only know the older, guy that was England captain. The only thing that matters to these kids is whether they can beat players 30 times before scoring, otherwise they&#39;re crap in their heads. Kind of tired of what football fans have become to be honest lol. If they WERE around when he was playing at United and Madrid then they clearly know nothing about football",
            "Not only was he a fantastic player, who was actually underappreciated and underused in a less technical era, the thing that makes him a true all time great was the fact he always showed and took things to another level in the big games.  Very few players do that.",
            "As a brand?...legend. As a footballer? Overrated",

            "A bit of both..?",
            "Bekham&#39;s everything was beauty except his speed and dribbling",
            "I think Beckham was very good. He was good on set pieces &amp; an incredible passer especially a long ball, but I never thought he ranked as the best in his position at any time in his career.",
            "unfortunately this video is too much about quote and people opinion about him, rather than talk about his ability, tactical analysis,etc. Even one of his main strength, workrate, is never mentioned in this video.",
            "I’m 21 and this video made me realise beckham is a one in a billion player some of those crosses from deep are absolutely spot on strikers food Trent is also like this but not as good as David",
            "&quot;I should thank him for the many balls he gave me&quot;💀",
            "Bechkam never missed a pass",
            "He had success in England, Spain and the USA. Same cannot be said for some other players that people tend to rate above him despite being 1 team wonders, but now play for him.",
            "Becks brought the goals, the money and the fans, we have to thank him, and he waited in line for the Queen’s funeral",
            "The only thing i think of when you say David Beckham i think very  handsome man with Man U jersey",
            "Overratted. Its was an okay player.",
            "Beckham is underrated. His right foot was so good that people didn&#39;t realize that his left foot and dribbling skills were not that bad, his header was ok, his pace and speed were not that slow, and his ball control was amazing.",
            "Damn Theo Walcott lol",
            "Best passer ever he&#39;s clear of kdb",
            "the hardest in football is the long pass",
            "Best crosses ever and the best gift ever for strikers in the team",

            "What do i think of when i hear the name David Beckham?  He&#39;s that feller that can bend it like himself.   😅",
            "Those who says he is overrated probably has never seen him play…he may not be the fastest player or the best dribbler to play on the wing but his crosses are very very dangerous…his pin point delivery is a dream to many strikers…and his work rate was unbelievable…it was a joy to watch him play with gary neville on the right side",
            "Beckha  is one of my favorite players and I may be a bit biased but I believe that he is a top 15 player atleast",
            "He wasn&#39;t overrated. He played to his strenghts. He was a set peice master, could pick a pass out anywhere and assisted so many goal through his presicion. No we may not have been a technical player, but that wasn&#39;t his job. He could not take the ball in himself, and a sprinter he was not, but he could find a man at 70 yards with pinpoint accuracy each and every time.",
            "Very good player.",
            "&quot;I should thank him for the many balls he gave me&quot; What? 💀",
            "One of the greats but not Appreciated by his own country !!!",
            "Absolute legend!",
            "Hahaha..todays players would love to have some of his skills. Absolute legend!",
            "Theres no doubt that David Beckham is a legendary player,his passing, dribbling,crosses and freekickas are just so amazing ......no doubt the best English midfilder ever",
            "Those who call him &quot;overrated&quot; should first try to become a professional footballer, then WIN 6 ENGLAND LEAGUES AND A CHAMPIONS LEAGUE",
            "The fact that many times he was sitting on the bench for Real Madrid shows that he was not as good as the media and casuals thought he was. He was my favorite player growing up when he played for Man United and he did come second twice for Fifa world player of the year from 1997 to 2003 he was very good. He had some great moments for England but then bad ones as well like missing penalties in important matches. Very average dribbler at top level but great passer and free kick taker.  But a lot of Americans seemed to think he was the Michael Jordan of International football at one time when he was not at that level Jordan was not starting on the bench for his team. On his Real Madrid team there were many players who had better careers than him Ronaldo, Zidane,Figo, Raul, Roberto Carlos that&#39;s 5 players just on his team! Think about all the other players in La liga, Premier League, Serie A ect ect. If you have 5 players better than you on your own team how good are you?????",
            "Legend; 115 national caps 60 as captain, he won championship trophies in the best leagues with the best teams in the world, and now has galvanised Football in the USA beyond anything thats been seen before! Thats just his playing career.",
            "Sensational workrate, professionalism and ball striking. My problem with him was that he preferred to hit glory passes rather than look for the simpler options. Gerrard had the same issue. Instead of working the play in a way that would unlock teams through the middle, it was always try to get around them with the 50yd wonder pass.  This approach never worked at international level.",

            "I have to make a poop",
            "There are lots of better footballers who aren&#39;t as famous as him. Using that metric he indeed is overrated.",
            "you need to do vid on Paul Scholes",
            "I grew up watching becks play and on god, he was one of the best. That freekick touch was sublime.",
            "You don&#39;t get to play in Man United and Real Madrid for being overrated or because you are looking good. Ferguson doesn&#39;t care if you are Jesus, if Jesus can&#39;t kick the ball, he won&#39;t be allowed to play for Ferguson. He was not overrated, he did a damn good job as player"

            "From the Giving Evidence website: <br><br>“As well as finding no evidence that Royals bring revenue to their patronee charities, we also found no reason that donors should assume that a charity with a Royal patronage outperforms its peers. Take air ambulances. The UK has 21 air ambulance charities, each serving a different ‘patch’. The ones with senior Royal patrons are: Cornwall (Camilla: Duchess of Cornwall), London (William: who lives in London), Wiltshire (Camilla, who has a house in neighbouring Gloucestershire), and Yorkshire (Andrew: Duke of York). It seems likely that these selections are driven less by quality than by history and geography.<br><br>We found no evidence that a concentration of Royal patronages of charities in a geographic area increases the generosity of people in that area. (We compared English regions on (i) the number of Royal patronages they have, and (ii) the proportion of people who have given recently). And looking internationally, we found no evidence that a resident Royal family makes a nation more generous. In short, we looked from many angles, and did not find evidence of a beneficial effect from any of them.”",
